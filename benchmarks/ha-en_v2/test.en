Hitoshi worked in the accounting office of an employment agency in Japan .
Hitoshi explained that his conscience would not let him do dishonest work .
As a result , Hitoshi’s superior threatened to fire him , and he ultimately lost his job .
In the months that followed , Hitoshi became downhearted over his employment prospects .
During one job interview , for instance , Hitoshi mentioned that he could not engage in dishonest work .
Hitoshi’s family and friends encouraged him to remain firm in his resolve to be honest , yet he began to have some doubts .
For instance , he said , “ I wondered if being honest about my faith was a good idea . ”
Hitoshi’s experience is a disturbing reminder that not everyone prizes honesty .
In fact , some may even view it as a liability , particularly in the business community .
“ I’m surrounded by people who are dishonest , ” said a working woman in South Africa , “ and sometimes the pressure to conform is very great . ”
“ We didn’t expect lying to be such a common part of daily life . ”
Is it not strange that most people abhor the idea of being lied to yet there are few practices more common than lying ?
Why are lying , stealing , and other forms of dishonesty so common today ?
How does dishonesty affect society as a whole ?
And more important , how can we avoid getting caught up in these dishonest practices ?
“ There are always difficult situations that can be solved with a little dishonesty . ” ​ — Samantha , South Africa .
Do you agree with that statement ?
Like Samantha , all of us have faced difficult situations at one time or another .
When the truth comes to light , however , dishonesty often brings negative consequences .
Trust can be shattered , however , by just one act of dishonesty .
And when trust has been broken , it can be very difficult to rebuild .
Thus , dishonesty could be likened to a virus ​ — the more contact you have with a person who is deceitful , the greater your risk of being “ infected ” with dishonesty yourself .
Please consider a few Bible principles .
Uttering false and malicious statements that injure a person’s reputation .
“ We trust we have an honest conscience , as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things . ” ​ — Hebrews 13 : 18 .
In the Bible , the original Greek word that is sometimes translated “ honesty ” literally means “ something that is intrinsically good . ”
Christians take seriously the apostle Paul’s inspired words : “ We wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things . ”
Most people glance at themselves in a mirror every morning before going out in public .
Because they want to look their best .
God’s Word frankly admits that we are inclined to do what is bad .
“ The inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up , ” says Genesis 8 : 21 .
The apostle Paul gave a vivid description of his own fight against sin , saying : “ I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within , but I see in my body another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my body . ” ​ — Romans 7 : 22 , 23 .
We still have a choice in the matter .
To be honest , we need a strong moral code .
Sadly , however , many people spend more time deciding on their personal ‘ dress code ’ than they do on thinking about a personal moral code .
The book The ( Honest ) Truth About Dishonesty put it this way : “ Essentially , we cheat up to the level that allows us to retain our self - image as reasonably honest individuals . ”
Thankfully , there is .
Millions of people the world over have found that the Bible perfectly fills that need .
It gives reliable guidance on such matters as family life , employment , morality , and spirituality .
Its laws and principles apply to all national groups , races , tribes , and peoples .
By peering into the Bible , meditating on what it says , and applying its counsel , we can train our heart to be honest and upright .
Still , there is more to winning the battle against dishonesty than gaining an accurate knowledge of the Bible .
After all , we live in a morally depraved world that pressures us to accept its corrupt standards .
That is why we need to pray to God for his help and support .
By doing so , we can have the courage to stand up for what is right and to be honest in all things .
Hitoshi , quoted in the opening article , profited from having a reputation of being an honest worker .
“ I am thankful , ” says Hitoshi , “ that I was able to find work that allows me to keep a clean conscience . ”
Others have found the same to be true .
Later , I married , and my husband and I began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses .
We learned that Jehovah * God hates dishonest practices , so we decided to change our lifestyle .
In 1990 we dedicated our lives to Jehovah and got baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses . ” ​ — Proverbs 6 : 16 - 19 .
“ In the past , my house was full of stolen goods , but now it is free from such things ; and this gives me a clean conscience .
Thinking back over my many years of dishonesty , I am grateful to Jehovah for his great mercy .
“ When my boss found out that I had turned down a bribe from a potential customer , he said to me : ‘ Your God makes you such a trustworthy person !
To be honest in all things enables me to have a clean conscience before Jehovah God .
“ I work as an executive assistant at an international bank .
The widespread view is , ‘ What’s the harm in a little dishonesty if it promotes wealth and helps the economy ? ’
I am resolved to remain honest and face whatever consequences may come .
My employers know that I will not lie to them or for them . ” ​ — Tom , United States .
When the thieves were finally revealed , my employer thanked me for being honest .
Being honest in a dishonest world calls for courage .
But in the end , we can gain the trust and respect of others . ” ​ — Kaori , Japan .

Unless otherwise indicated , Scripture quotations are from the modern - language New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures .
Bebe had been very close to her father .
The remark came from a well - meaning family friend , but Bebe found it more cutting than comforting .
“ His death wasn’t for the best , ” she kept repeating to herself .
It was clear that when Bebe recounted the incident in a book years later , she was still grieving .
As Bebe came to see , it can take a long time for someone to overcome grief , especially when the bereaved person was very close to the deceased .
In the Bible , death is aptly described as “ the last enemy . ”
It breaks into our lives with irresistible force , often when we are completely unprepared , and it robs us of those we hold dear .
None of us are immune to its ravages .
So it is not surprising if we feel at a loss when it comes to coping with death and its aftermath .
Perhaps you have wondered : ‘ How long does it take to get over grief ?
How can I comfort others who have been bereaved ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
Have you ever had a brief bout with illness ?
As an example , consider how the patriarch Abraham reacted when his wife died .
The Bible says that “ Abraham began to mourn and to weep over Sarah . ”
The expression “ began to ” suggests that it took some time for him to cope with his loss .
He grieved for “ many days , ” and his family members were unable to comfort him .
Several years later , the death of Joseph still weighed heavily on his mind . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband , Robert , died on July 9 , 2008 .
Six years later the pain in my heart is still there .
I don’t think I will ever get over my loss of Rob . ” ​ — Gail , aged 60 .
“ Although I have been without my dear wife for more than 18 years , I still miss her and grieve over my loss .
Whenever I see something in nature that is attractive , my thoughts go to her , and I cannot help wondering how she would have enjoyed seeing what I am seeing . ” ​ — Etienne , aged 84 .
Clearly , such painful and long - lasting feelings are only natural .
Each person grieves in his or her own way , and it would be unwise to judge the way another person responds to tragedy .
At the same time , we may need to hold off from condemning ourselves if our reaction to loss seems excessive .
As we note in the “ Imitate Their Faith ” article in this issue , Isaac was still grieving over the loss of his mother , Sarah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 67 .
For instance , you may find that some will advise you not to cry or show your feelings in any way .
Others may push you to do the opposite and expose all your feelings .
The Bible presents a more balanced view , one that is supported by modern research .
In some cultures it is considered unmanly for a male to cry .
But is there a real need to feel ashamed about shedding tears , even in public ?
Mental - health experts acknowledge that tearfulness is a normal part of grieving .
And grieving may , in time , help you to move on despite the enormity of your loss .
Suppressing grief , however , may do more harm than good .
The Bible lends no support to the notion that it is wrong or unmanly to shed tears of grief .
At the death of his dear friend Lazarus , Jesus openly wept , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
Bouts of anger are often part of grieving , especially in cases of sudden , unexpected death .
There are many reasons why a bereaved person may feel angry , such as when thoughtless and unfounded comments are made by a respected person .
“ I was only 14 years old when my father died , ” explains a South African man named Mike .
“ At the funeral , the Anglican minister said that God needs good people and takes them early .
* This angered me because we desperately needed our father .
Especially in the case of unexpected death , the bereaved person may repeatedly think , ‘ It might not have happened if only I had done this or that . ’
If you are being plagued by such feelings of guilt and anger , it is important not to bottle up these emotions .
Rather , speak to a friend who will listen and reassure you that such irrational feelings are common to many bereaved ones .
The Bible reminds us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distress . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The best Friend a bereaved person can have is our Creator , Jehovah God .
Pour out your heart to him in prayer because “ he cares for you . ”
Moreover , he promises that all who do so will have their thoughts and feelings soothed by “ the peace of God that surpasses all understanding . ”
Also , allow God to help you heal by means of his consoling Word , the Bible .
Having such thoughts to ponder over may be especially helpful at night when you are alone and find it hard to sleep . ​ — Isaiah 57 : 15 .
Recently , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will call Jack , lost his beloved wife to cancer .
“ When I pray to Jehovah , ” he explains , “ I never feel alone .
I often wake up during the night and cannot get back to sleep .
After reading and meditating on comforting thoughts from the Scriptures and then pouring out the feelings of my heart in prayer , I sense a calmness and a transcending peace come over me , putting my mind and heart at rest and enabling me to sleep . ”
A young woman named Vanessa lost her mother to illness .
She too has experienced the power of prayer .
“ In my most difficult times , ” she says , “ I would just call on God’s name and break down in tears .
Jehovah listened to my prayers and always gave me the strength I needed . ”
Some bereavement counselors advise those who are struggling with grief to get involved in helping others or to volunteer their time in some community service .
Doing so can bring joy and may ease a person’s grief .
Many bereaved Christians have found that working to help others has brought them great comfort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God feels for you in your pain . ​ — Psalm 55 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God patiently listens to the prayers of his servants . ​ — Psalm 86 : 5 ; 1 Thessalonians 5 : 17 .
God misses people who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God promises to resurrect the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
Have you ever felt helpless when someone near to you was grieving over the loss of a loved one ?
Sometimes we may feel unsure of what to say or do ​ — so we wind up saying and doing nothing .
But there are practical , helpful things that we can do .
Often , all that is needed is your presence along with a simple expression , such as “ I am so sorry . ”
In many cultures , giving the person a hug or a gentle squeeze of the arm is an effective way to show you care .
If the bereaved one wants to talk , listen sympathetically .
Best of all , do something for the bereaved family , perhaps performing a chore the grieving one has not been able to care for , such as cooking a meal , caring for the children , or helping with funeral arrangements if that is desired .
Such actions may speak louder than the most eloquent words .
In time , you may be moved to talk about the deceased , perhaps focusing on some good qualities or happy experiences .
Such conversation may even bring a smile to the bereaved person’s face .
For example , Pam ​ — who lost her husband , Ian , six years ago — ​ says : “ People sometimes tell me good things that Ian did that I never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
Researchers report that many bereaved people receive a lot of initial help but that their needs are soon forgotten as friends get busy again with their own lives .
Therefore , make a point of contacting a bereaved friend on a regular basis after the loss .
* Many grieving ones deeply appreciate this opportunity to relieve themselves of prolonged feelings of grief .
Consider the example of Kaori , a young Japanese woman who was devastated by the loss of her mother followed by the loss of her older sister 15 months later .
Thankfully , she received ongoing support from loyal friends .
One named Ritsuko is much older than Kaori and offered to be her close friend .
“ To be honest , ” says Kaori , “ I wasn’t happy about that .
I didn’t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I didn’t think that anyone could .
However , because of the way Mama Ritsuko treated me , I came to feel close to her .
Every week , we went out in the evangelizing work together and went to Christian meetings together .
She invited me to have tea with her , brought me meals , and wrote me letters and cards many times .
Mama Ritsuko’s positive attitude had a good influence on me . ”
Twelve years have passed since Kaori’s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time evangelizers .
“ Mama Ritsuko , ” Kaori says , “ continues to show her concern .
When I go back home , I always visit her and enjoy her upbuilding association . ”
Another example of someone who benefited from ongoing support is Poli , one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Cyprus .
Poli had a kind husband , Sozos , who set a good example as a Christian shepherd by often inviting orphans and widows to their home for association and a meal .
Sadly , at the age of 53 , Sozos died of a brain tumor .
There , they began associating with a congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
“ The friends in my new congregation , ” recalls Poli , “ did not know anything about our past and our difficult circumstances .
But that did not stop them from approaching us and embracing us with their kind words and practical help .
How precious that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
Those taking the lead in the congregation showed a great deal of personal interest in Daniel .
One in particular made sure to include Daniel when enjoying association with friends or when going out to play ball . ”
Both mother and son are doing well today .
To be sure , there are many ways we can offer practical help and comfort to those who mourn .
The Bible also comforts us by means of a thrilling hope for the future .
Some have even marked the date of the death on their calendar as a reminder to offer comfort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the date of the loss .
You may recall that Gail , mentioned earlier in this series , doubts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , Rob .
However , she is looking forward to seeing him again in God’s promised new world .
My feelings really go out to people who have lost someone they love but who are not aware of this hope of seeing their loved one again . ”
Soon , God will do just that ​ — for Job and countless others — ​ when this earth is transformed into a paradise .
“ There is going to be a resurrection , ” the Bible confirms at Acts 24 : 15 .
“ Do not be amazed at this , ” Jesus assures us , “ for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out . ”
The same will happen to all who respond with appreciation to God’s merciful provision of a resurrection to life on earth .
If you have suffered the loss of someone dear to you , the information we have discussed may not completely take away your grief .
But by meditating on God’s promises found in the Bible , you can find real hope and the strength to keep going . ​ — 1 Thessalonians 4 : 13 .

WHAT ELSE CAN WE LEARN FROM THE BIBLE ?
“ God . . . will wipe out every tear from their eyes , and death will be no more . ” ​ — Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
This issue of The Watchtower discusses how God will fulfill that promise and what it can mean for you .
COVER SUBJECT | WHY DID JESUS SUFFER AND DIE ?
In the spring of 33 C.E . , Jesus the Nazarene was executed .
He had been falsely charged with sedition , savagely beaten , and nailed to a stake .
But God raised him back to life , and 40 days later , Jesus ascended to heaven .
This extraordinary account comes to us from the four Gospels of the Christian Greek Scriptures , commonly called the New Testament .
On the other hand , if those events really did happen , then there is a bright future for mankind , one in which you can share .
So , are the Gospel accounts fact or fiction ?
Unlike fanciful legends , the Gospel writings reflect painstaking accuracy and attention to detail .
For example , they abound with names of real places , many of which can be visited today .
They tell about real people , whose existence has been corroborated by secular historians . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
Jesus himself is mentioned by secular writers of the first and second centuries .
* His manner of death , as described in the Gospels , agrees with Roman executional methods of the time .
Moreover , events are related in a factual and candid manner ​ — even portraying some of Jesus ’ disciples unfavorably .
All these factors strongly indicate that the Gospel writers were honest and accurate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is generally accepted that Jesus lived and died , some would question his resurrection .
Even his apostles did not believe the initial report of his having returned to life .
All doubt was removed , however , when they and other disciples saw the resurrected Jesus on separate occasions .
In fact , in one case , there were more than 500 eyewitnesses present . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
At the risk of being arrested and killed , the disciples courageously proclaimed Jesus ’ resurrection to all ​ — even to the very ones who had executed him .
Would so many disciples have been so bold if they were not absolutely sure that Jesus had really been resurrected ?
In fact , the reality of the resurrection of Jesus is the driving force behind the impact that Christianity has had on the world both then and now .
The Gospel accounts of Jesus ’ death and resurrection bear all the necessary marks of an authentic historical record .
Carefully reading them will convince you that these events really happened .
Your conviction can be further strengthened when you understand why they took place .
Tacitus , born about 55 C.E . , wrote that “ Christus , from whom the name [ Christians ] had its origin , suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators , Pontius Pilatus . ”
Jesus is also referred to by Suetonius ( first century ) ; Jewish historian Josephus ( first century ) ; and Pliny the Younger , governor of Bithynia ( early second century ) .
Then , too , it is unlikely that Jesus ’ many opposers would write anything that would lend credibility to the reports about him .
Regarding Jesus ’ resurrection , Peter , one of his apostles , explained : “ God raised this one up on the third day and allowed him to become manifest , not to all the people , but to witnesses appointed beforehand by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead . ”
Matthew’s Gospel tells us that when the religious enemies heard reports of Jesus ’ resurrection , they schemed to suppress them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus wanted his resurrection to be kept secret ?
No , for Peter went on to say : “ He ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness that this is the one decreed by God to be judge of the living and the dead . ”
True Christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ Through one man [ Adam ] sin entered into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12
What would you say if you were asked , “ Do you want to live forever ? ”
Most people would probably say that they want to but that they feel it is unrealistic to consider it .
Death is a normal part of life , they say , the natural outcome of our existence .
Suppose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ Are you ready to die ? ”
Under normal circumstances , most people would answer no .
The Bible shows that God created humans with the desire and the will to live .
In fact , it says that “ he has even put eternity in their heart . ” ​ — Ecclesiastes 3 : 11 .
The reality , though , is that humans do not live forever .
Furthermore , has God done anything to remedy the situation ?
The Bible’s answers are heartening , and they have a direct bearing on why Jesus suffered and died .
The first three chapters of the Bible book of Genesis tell us that God set before the first human couple , Adam and Eve , the prospect of unending life and told them what they would have to do to gain it .
Then the account describes how they failed to obey God and lost that prospect .
The story is told simply ​ — so simply that some are quick to dismiss it as folklore .
But Genesis , like the Gospels , gives every indication of being a factual , historical record .
What has been the result of Adam’s failure to obey ?
The Bible answers this way : “ Through one man [ Adam ] sin entered into the world and death through sin , and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned . ”
He thus lost the prospect of endless life and eventually died .
Being his descendants , we have inherited his sinful condition .
But has God done anything to remedy the situation ?
Yes , God made arrangements to redeem , or buy back , what Adam had lost for his descendants , namely , the prospect of endless life .
“ The wages sin pays is death , ” says the Bible at Romans 6 : 23 .
This means that death is the consequence of sin .
Likewise , we sin and are therefore subject to sin’s wages , death .
But we were born in this sinful condition through no fault of our own .
So God lovingly sent his Son , Jesus , to accept ‘ the wages of sin ’ for us .
Jesus ’ death opens the way to a happy , endless life
Since one man , the perfect man Adam , brought sin and death on us through disobedience , a perfect man obedient even till death was needed to release us from that burden .
The Bible explains it this way : “ Just as through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners , so also through the obedience of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
He left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our behalf .
As a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous standing with God and gain the prospect of endless life .
Why , though , was it necessary for Jesus to die to accomplish this ?
Could not Almighty God have simply issued a decree that Adam’s descendants be allowed to live forever ?
Had God set justice aside in this instance , people might have wondered whether he would do so in other matters as well .
For example , would he be fair in determining who among Adam’s offspring qualify for eternal life ?
Could he be trusted to keep his promises ?
God’s adherence to justice in working out our salvation is assurance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacrificial death , God opened the way to endless life in Paradise on earth .
Note Jesus ’ words as recorded at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son , so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death is thus an expression not only of God’s unfailing justice but , more specially , of his great love for humans .
However , why did Jesus have to suffer and die in the painful way that was described in the Gospels ?
By subjecting himself to the extreme test and remaining faithful , Jesus refuted once and for all the Devil’s claim that humans would not remain loyal to God when under trial .
That claim might have seemed valid after Satan induced perfect Adam to sin .
But Jesus ​ — who was Adam’s perfect equivalent — ​ remained obedient despite severe suffering .
He thus proved that Adam too could have obeyed God if he had chosen to do so .
By enduring under trial , Jesus left us a model to follow .
God rewarded his Son’s perfect obedience , granting Jesus immortal life in heaven .
Jesus indicated what we need to do when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

It is more precious than corals ; nothing you desire can compare to it . ”
Jesus Christ set a good example of honesty .
As managing director , I was expected to come to ‘ an agreement ’ with the tax agent by bribing him to overlook the company’s fraudulent practices .

I am a good example for my two sons , and I have qualified for privileges in the congregation .
Among tax auditors and others with whom I do business , I now have the reputation of being an honest man . ”

[ 1 ] ( paragraph 14 ) See chapter 21 of the book God’s Kingdom Rules !
During an assembly , a brother asked me if I would like to preach .
We went to the territory , and he gave me some booklets about God’s Kingdom .
One of the sisters there gave us children Bible lessons based on the Bible and the book The Harp of God .
As a teenager , I enjoyed giving people hope from God’s Word .
The brother stopped his bicycle and asked me to sit down with him on a log .
He said : “ Who gave you authority to judge who is a goat ?
Let’s just be happy giving people the good news and leave the judging to Jehovah . ”
Another older brother taught me that to find happiness in giving , we sometimes have to endure patiently .
Years later , his patience was rewarded when his wife was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses .
After the war , I pioneered for two years in southern Ireland .
We did not realize how much power the priests had .
I had never sailed before , so I was excited .
For five years , we preached mainly on isolated islands where there were no Witnesses .
The crew of missionaries aboard the Sibia ( left to right ) : Ron Parkin , Dick Ryde , Gust Maki , and Stanley Carter
Often , they gave us fresh fish , avocados , and peanuts .
Then at dusk we rang the ship’s bell .
It was lovely to see how seriously some of them took their assignment .
When we arrived , I met and fell in love with Maxine Boyd , a beautiful missionary sister .
So I said to myself , ‘ Ronald , if you want this girl , you’ve got to act quickly . ’
After three weeks I proposed , and after six weeks we were married .
Maxine and I were assigned as missionaries to Puerto Rico , so I never went out on the new boat .
For example , in the village of Potala Pastillo , there were two Witness families with many children , and I used to play the flute for them .
I asked one of the little girls , Hilda , if she wanted to come and preach with us .
We bought her a pair , and she came preaching with us .
She was about to leave for her assignment in Ecuador , and she said : “ You don’t recognize me , do you ?
I am the little girl from Pastillo who had no shoes . ”
At first , Lennart Johnson and I did most of the work .
Nathan Knorr , who was then taking the lead among Jehovah’s Witnesses , came to Puerto Rico .
Later , he gave me strong counsel about being organized and said that he was disappointed in me .
Father did not accept the truth when Mother and I did .
My dear wife , Maxine , died in 2011 .
I am really looking forward to seeing her again in the resurrection .
After 60 years on the island , I felt as Puerto Rican as a coquí , the popular little Puerto Rican tree frog that sings ko - kee , ko - kee at dusk .
Some who come to see me want to discuss personal or family problems .
Everything we do at Bethel is sacred service .
Wherever we serve Jehovah , we have opportunities to praise him .

The first article shows how our faith can grow and remain strong .
Let me explain what led to that conversation .
I WAS born in Wichita , Kansas , U.S.A . , on December 10 , 1936 , the oldest of four children .
Then a soldier walked by , and the doctor yelled , “ Do something about this yellow coward ! ”
The soldier could see that the man was drunk , so he told him , “ Go home and sober up ! ”
He owned two barbershops in Wichita , and the doctor was one of his clients !
With my parents , going to a convention in Wichita in the 1940 ’ s
With Jehovah’s blessing and their zealous work , a congregation was started .
We were assigned to special pioneer in Walnut Ridge , Arkansas .
Then in 1962 , we were thrilled to receive an invitation to the 37th class of Gilead .
In the ministry in Nairobi with Mary and Chris Kanaiya
Soon after , our first daughter , Kimberly , was born , and 17 months later , we had Stephany .
We would also go camping with them and would have very enjoyable conversations around the campfire .
We arranged to have some who were in the full - time ministry stay in our home .
They were shocked and started to cry and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and direction of God’s organization , we did our best to raise them to love Jehovah .
On a later trip , Kimberly met one of his workmates , Brian Llewellyn .
So they did stay free until they were at least 23 .
At the same time , Brian and Kimberly were invited to work at London Bethel and later were transferred to Malawi Bethel .
The day after we left for the Watchtower Educational Center in Patterson , Linda called to tell us that Mother had died .
Next , we taught the course in Zimbabwe and then in Zambia .
In 2006 , Brian and Kimberly moved next door to us to raise their two daughters , Mackenzie and Elizabeth .

Are you among those who are learning another language ?
( Read Nehemiah 13 : 23 , 24 . )
( b ) How can we reach our goal ?
We must recognize that when we prepare for the ministry , for the meetings , or for a talk , we may not necessarily apply what we read to ourselves .
Since my mind is mainly involved in an intellectual exercise , my heart is not necessarily touched by the spiritual thoughts I am reading .
That is why I regularly set aside time to study the Bible and other publications in my mother tongue . ”
“ It annoyed him to go out in the ministry in another language , whereas before he loved preaching in his native language , French , ” says Muriel .
“ When we realized that this situation had hindered our son from making spiritual advancement , ” explains Serge , “ we decided to move back to our former congregation . ”
Make sure that the truth reaches the hearts of your children ( See paragraphs 14 , 15 )

When that happened , how did David react ?
Past sins ( See paragraphs 11 - 14 )
11 , 12 . ( a ) After he sinned , what could David not do ?
What David could not do : David could not undo what he had done .

Jehovah provided the ransom at great cost to himself .
When will Jehovah become “ all things to everyone ” ?
How can we show that we love Jehovah’s name ?
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 15 , 16 . )

This article will help us to answer those questions .
Yet , Jehovah viewed those kings as having a complete heart .
Will God view us as having a complete heart , despite mistakes we make ?
We lived on a small farm in eastern South Dakota .
Farming was an important part of our family’s life , but it was not the most important part .
My dad , Clarence , and later my uncle Alfred , served as company servant ( now called coordinator of the body of elders ) in our small congregation in Conde , South Dakota .
My sister , Dorothy , and I became Kingdom publishers when we were six .
Conventions and assemblies were an important part of our lives .
The Bible says : “ The one walking with the wise will become wise , ” and there were many wise ones in my family who supported my decision to pioneer .
When they were serving congregations nearby , they sometimes invited me to go with them in the ministry .
As a new Bethelite , with a farm truck
The farm on Staten Island included the radio station WBBR .

What about your dedication vow or your marriage vow ?
When we believe that we have personally experienced or observed an injustice , our faith , humility , and loyalty may be tested .
“ The world is passing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of God remains forever . ” ​ — 1 JOHN 2 : 17 .
What will Jehovah do about wicked people and corrupt organizations ?
The Bible says : “ The world is passing away . ”

10 , 11 . ( a ) What injustices did Joseph experience ?
( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 . )
Loyalty to Jehovah and to our brothers will protect us from making such a mistake .

Why should we draw even closer to Jehovah if we experience injustice in the congregation ?
How can we show that we have confidence in “ the Judge of all the earth ” ?
See Willi Diehl’s life story , “ Jehovah Is My God , in Whom I Will Trust , ” in the November 1 , 1991 , issue of The Watchtower .

See the article “ Anxiety About Money ” in the July 1 , 2015 , issue of The Watchtower .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What injustice did Naboth and his sons experience ?
( b ) What two qualities will we consider in this article ?
What kind of man was Naboth , and why did he refuse to sell his vineyard to King Ahab ?
Naboth was faithful to Jehovah at a time when most Israelites were following the bad example of King Ahab and his wife , wicked Queen Jezebel .
Read 1 Kings 21 : 1 - 3 .
He respectfully explained : “ It is unthinkable , from Jehovah’s standpoint , for me to give you the inheritance of my forefathers . ”
Why would humility have been a protection to Naboth’s family and friends ?
( Read Deuteronomy 32 : 3 , 4 . )
( b ) In what ways will humility protect us ?
How will you respond if the elders announce a decision that you do not agree with ?
What account will we now consider , and why ?
How was Peter corrected , and what questions arise ?
In fact , he was later inspired to write two letters that became part of the Bible .
3 Helping “ Foreign Residents ” to “ Serve Jehovah With Rejoicing ”
The second article considers how applying Bible principles will help immigrant parents to make decisions that will benefit their children .
“ We could see people running , shooting .
My parents and 11 of us siblings fled for our lives with only the clothes on our backs .
How did Jesus and many of his disciples become refugees ?
He said : “ When they persecute you in one city , flee to another . ”
( b ) are living in a camp ?
My feet were so swollen that I told my family to go on without me .
My father ​ — not about to abandon me to the rebel forces — ​ carried me .
They gossiped , drank , gambled , stole , and were immoral . ”
( Read 1 John 3 : 17 , 18 . )
( b ) Why do they need our patient help ?
They need to see that we care about them .
( b ) How can refugees show gratitude ?
How can we help our brothers and sisters who are refugees ?
( a ) What temptation do refugees need to resist ?
This is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
They need to sense Jehovah’s love and compassion among their fellow Christians .
Many of today’s refugees come from countries where our preaching work is restricted .
She said : “ The brothers there treated them like close relatives , providing food , clothes , shelter , and transportation .
Who else would welcome strangers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
Only Jehovah’s Witnesses ! ” ​ — Read John 13 : 35 .
As soon as possible after a refugee arrives , elders should follow the direction in Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will , chapter 8 , paragraph 30 .
In the meantime , they can ask discreet questions about a refugee’s congregation and ministry to discern his spiritual condition .
“ No greater joy do I have than this : that I should hear that my children go on walking in the truth . ” ​ — 3 JOHN 4 .
How can parents set a good example for their children ?
How can family heads decide which language congregation the family will attend ?

I couldn’t understand the meetings , and I didn’t identify with my parents ’ culture . ”
3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not expect of their children ?
When your children see you “ seeking first the Kingdom , ” they learn to depend on Jehovah for their daily needs .
Never get so busy that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from learning your language ?
Parents , if that describes your children , can you learn at least some of the local language ?
A child who communicates best in another spoken language deserves the same concern , would you not agree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
How can parents help children who may need to study in two languages ?
( a ) Who must decide which language congregation to attend ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
But when we saw that they were getting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we decided to move to the local - language congregation .
Together , we regularly attended meetings and shared in the ministry .
We also invited local friends to join us for meals and excursions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and Friend .
We considered this to be much more important than their mastering our language . ”
Samuel adds : “ To keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and I also attended meetings in our language .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the basics of my parents ’ language , but the language spoken at the meetings was over my head , ” recalls Kristina .
Young people , do you think that you would prefer being part of a local - language congregation ?
“ When my siblings and I got into our teens , we wanted to switch to the local - language congregation , ” says Nadia , who now serves at Bethel .
“ Now we’re grateful that our parents worked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the foreign - language congregation .
It has enriched our lives and broadened our opportunities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the local language may need help to reach their children’s heart .
Both children and parents benefit from association with the congregation ( See paragraphs 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
And I enjoyed the leisure activities we shared in as a group . ”
Parents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .
( Read 2 Chronicles 15 : 7 . )
Put your child’s friendship with Jehovah ahead of your own interests .
But it wasn’t until 1946 that I really understood Bible truth .
Eventually , I learned sign language and had fun playing with the other children .
She accepted a magazine subscription and wanted me to meet her husband , Gary .
Eventually , five from their class became Jehovah’s Witnesses .
At that time , she gave me a piece of candy and asked if we could be friends .
When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
She continued her study and later got baptized .
When we got married in 1960 , her parents did not come to our wedding .

Faye and James , Jerry and Evelyn , Shannan and Steven
We are now part of the Calgary Sign - Language Congregation , where I continue to serve as an elder .
How can we keep our love for Jehovah strong ?
How can we deepen our love for Bible truth ?
Why is it important to have affection for our brothers ?
What may have caused the love of some Christians to grow cold ?
People today have less and less love for God .
Show love for Jehovah ( See paragraph 10 )
( Read Psalm 119 : 97 - 100 . )
Show love for Bible truth ( See paragraph 14 )
On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new commandment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among yourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apostle John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”
Show love for the brothers and sisters ( See paragraph 17 )
What are some ways in which we can show love ?
Read 1 Thessalonians 4 : 9 , 10 .
“ Simon son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” ​ — JOHN 21 : 15 .
Then he said to them : “ ‘ Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some . ’
So they cast it , but they were not able to haul it in because of the large number of fish . ” ​ — John 21 : 1 - 6 .
( b ) What valuable lesson did a brother in Thailand learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me almost no time for spiritual matters .
“ After planning for about a year , ” he explained , “ I decided to become a street vendor and sell ice cream .
In the beginning , I struggled financially and got discouraged .
I got better acquainted with my customers ’ tastes and became more skillful in making ice cream .
Actually , I was better - off financially than when I worked with computers .
It has made me happier because I do not have the stress and worry that I had with my former job .
And most important , I now feel closer to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his baptism , he said : “ The only regret I have is that I lost so much time before I realized that serving Jehovah brings far more happiness than pursuing the entertainment offered by this world . ”
Jesus stated that “ no one can slave for two masters . ”
He added : “ You cannot slave for God and for Riches . ”
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 . )
See the article “ Is Your Recreation Beneficial ? ”
We also shared regularly in the field ministry . ”
We were so sad to leave our Bible students behind . ”
But then , a month later , they received thrilling news .

( Read Mark 10 : 28 - 30 . )
( a ) Why did the apostle Paul describe our ministry as a “ treasure in earthen vessels ” ?
( Read Romans 1 : 14 , 15 ; 2 Timothy 4 : 2 . )

“ Plans fail when there is no consultation . ”
Michael says , “ My brother genuinely forgave me . ”
“ Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another . ”
Now they get along well as they preach the good news .
That difference may seem unimportant ; yet , it can lead to serious problems . ”
After praying to Jehovah about the matter , I bought the sister a small gift and wrote her a card to apologize for my bad attitude .
We hugged each other and agreed to put the matter behind us .
We have not had any more problems . ”
FOR many people today , money is the big issue .
Why must the issue of sovereignty be settled ?
How important is the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty ?
Why , from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death , all things are continuing exactly as they were from creation’s beginning . ”

Give examples of how some are showing faithfulness in their use of unrighteous riches .
I am more generous in being forgiving , in being patient with others , and in being able to accept disappointments and counsel . ”
How did Abraham show that he trusted in God ?
( b ) How can we apply Paul’s counsel today ?
After calling Timothy “ a fine soldier of Christ Jesus , ” Paul told him : “ No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life , in order to gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier . ”
Jehovah blesses those who are “ rich in fine works . ”

“ FOR almost a year after the death of our son , we felt deep and excruciating pain , ” said Susi .
Every single time , the peace of God truly guarded our hearts and minds . ” ​ — Read Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
How did Jesus show empathy when Lazarus died ?
If you are grieving , you too can find soothing comfort from such scriptures as the following :
( Read 1 Thessalonians 5 : 11 . )
What do we need to remember about grief ?
Even when someone does express how he feels , it is not always easy for others to understand what he is trying to say .
At that moment , I don’t feel quite so alone in my grief . ”
“ Receiving a short encouraging message or an invitation to spend time with a fellow Christian helps me more than I can say , ” says Junia .
“ Those expressions make me feel loved and cared for . ”
“ Sometimes when sisters have come to comfort me , ” recalls Dalene , “ I have asked them if they are willing to say a prayer .

Their strong faith , their love , and their concern have been very faith - strengthening . ”
“ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distress . ”

But a few brothers and sisters planned a small gathering of my closest friends so that I wouldn’t be on my own . ”
“ Often the help and companionship offered when there is no special anniversary can be very beneficial , ” explains Junia .
“ Those spontaneous moments are so valuable and bring much comfort . ”
They have truly made me feel Jehovah’s loving arms around me . ”
Why are Jehovah’s promises a source of great comfort ?
God promises that “ he will do away with death forever , and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces . ”
Other scriptures that many have found comforting are Psalm 20 : 1 , 2 ; 31 : 7 ; 38 : 8 , 9 , 15 ; 55 : 22 ; 121 : 1 , 2 ; Isaiah 57 : 15 ; 66 : 13 ; Philippians 4 : 13 ; and 1 Peter 5 : 7 .

Today , Jehovah guides us with his Word , the Bible .
( Read Psalm 147 : 19 , 20 . )
What plans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
YOU young ones will probably agree that before starting a journey , it is wise to plan where you will go .
Life is like a journey , and the time to plan where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to plan for a happy future ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his image . ”
You will be happy when you imitate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also drew close to Jehovah by studying the Scriptures .
“ Plans fail when there is no consultation , but there is accomplishment through many advisers . ”
As with any career , you need time to become skilled .
At first , I couldn’t start any Bible studies , but later I moved to another territory , and within a month I started several studies .
One student began coming to the Kingdom Hall .
For example , Jacob , from North America , writes : “ When I was seven , many of my classmates were Vietnamese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made plans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by comparing the English and Vietnamese editions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a nearby Vietnamese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pioneering .
Later , I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment , where I am the only elder in a Vietnamese - language group .
Many Vietnamese people are amazed that I have learned their language .
They invite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have progressed to baptism . ” ​ — Compare Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encouraging the young brothers in our congregation and seeing their spiritual progress .
After I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers , I received a new pioneer assignment .
It’s true that I have never found anyone in the territory who progressed to baptism , but others have .
How may pioneer service lead to other opportunities ?
A brother named Kevin says : “ Ever since I was a little boy , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time someday .
Finally , I started pioneering when I was 19 .
I supported myself working part - time for a brother who was a builder .
I learned to install roofs , windows , and doors .
Later , I spent two years with a hurricane relief team , rebuilding Kingdom Halls and homes for the brothers .
When I heard about the construction needs in South Africa , I applied and was invited to go .
Here in Africa , I move from one Kingdom Hall project to another every few weeks .
We live together , study the Bible together , and work together .
I also enjoy preaching with the local brothers each week .
The plans I made as a boy have made me happy in ways I did not foresee . ”
Bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a half , I was invited to Bethel , where I learned to operate printing presses and later to do computer programming .
At Bethel , I enjoy hearing firsthand about the progress of the disciple - making activity worldwide .
I love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wants you to “ get a firm hold ” on a happy future .
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )
Then plan to do what is pleasing to him .
He has studied human behavior since man was created .
It’s something you have to find out for yourself . ”
and “ Do not let them lead you into disaster ! ”
Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more . ”
Do not be struck with terror or fear , for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go . ”
Listen to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
The second article highlights how Jehovah can do the unexpected by accomplishing things we could never imagine .
Like the farmer , we need to wait patiently .
What can we learn from the example of the prophet Micah ?
( Read Micah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of Micah , we will be willing to wait for Jehovah .
So we “ endure fully with patience and joy . ”
Abraham had to wait many years before his grandsons Esau and Jacob were born ( See paragraphs 9 , 10 )
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
Although you meant to harm me , God intended it to turn out well and to preserve many people alive , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) What helped David to wait patiently ?
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
What will help us to be willing to wait patiently ?
What lessons do we learn from what happened to the apostle Paul in Philippi ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
Soon after he arrived in Macedonia , he ended up in prison !
Why did Jehovah allow this to happen to Paul ?
Both he and Silas started “ praying and praising God with song . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did Paul’s situation change unexpectedly ?
What will we now discuss and review together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
Sometimes he surprises us by doing the unexpected .
Jehovah sent an angel to destroy 185,000 of Sennacherib’s soldiers in one night .
( a ) What lesson do we learn from what happened to Joseph ?
No doubt Jehovah’s actions exceeded all of Joseph’s expectations .
Think , too , about Joseph’s great - grandmother Sarah .
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah cares for us and wants us to succeed .
How can we strip off and keep off the old personality ?
By 1939 there were 6,000 of them in the [ concentration camps ] . ”
And you people have cleaned the stadium so nicely .
But most of all , you are truly multiracial . ”
But the more I had sexual relations , the more insecure I felt . ”
This way of life continued until Sakura was 23 years old .
It got so bad that I could not wait for the woman I was living with to leave the house so that I could watch pornographic videos . ”
What helped Stephen to put away anger and abusive speech ?
He says : “ Our family life improved dramatically .
Today , Stephen serves as a ministerial servant , and his wife has been a regular pioneer for several years .
Bible texts that encouraged me were Isaiah 55 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had abandoned sinful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah patiently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new personality . ”
We also benefit from God’s Word and his holy spirit when we prepare for and attend congregation meetings .
Some of the names in this article have been changed .
See chapter 25 in the book Questions Young People Ask ​ — Answers That Work , Volume 1 .
( Read Colossians 3 : 10 - 14 . )

What example did Jesus set in showing mildness and patience ?
Then he added : “ If you continue showing favoritism , you are committing sin . ”
Why is it important that we clothe ourselves with love ?
Love is also “ patient and kind ” and “ does not get puffed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ Little children , we should love , not in word or with the tongue , but in deed and truth . ”
But then I asked myself , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in dealing with this person ? ’
After reflecting on what Jesus would have done , I decided to let the matter go and not make an issue of it .
Later , I learned that my coworker had been coping with a serious health problem and was under a lot of stress .
I concluded that she probably did not really mean what she wrote .
Reflecting on Jesus ’ example of showing love even when provoked helped me to show similar love to my coworker . ”
By leaving heaven , “ he emptied himself ” in our behalf , even “ to the point of death . ”
PEACE : “ Putting up with one another in love ” allows us to enjoy “ the uniting bond of peace . ”
Would you not agree that such a peaceful spirit is truly unique in today’s divided world ?
Paul wrote : “ Love builds up . ”
The following day , they had outgrown the venue . ”
Below the picture was the caption : “ Invasion of the streets . ”
One congregation wrote , “ The only line that passes near this place is a telegraph line . ”

( Read Exodus 34 : 5 - 7 . )
( b ) Why should you be interested in what the Bible says about compassion ?
( a ) Why did Jehovah send angels to Sodom ?
( Read Exodus 22 : 26 , 27 . )
We read : “ Jehovah the God of their forefathers kept warning them by means of his messengers , warning them again and again , because he felt compassion for his people and for his dwelling place . ”
“ He started to teach them many things . ”
Instead , we need to do all we can now to help people .
One meaning of compassion is “ to suffer together . ”
How can young ones and their parents show courage ?

She writes : “ Growing up , I was really shy .
I could barely talk to people at the Kingdom Hall , much less knock on the doors of complete strangers . ”
With the help of her parents and others in the congregation , this young Christian achieved her goal of becoming a regular pioneer .
How can Psalm 37 : 25 and Hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents expend much effort and resources helping their children reach goals in such areas as sports , recreation , and education .
It makes so much more sense to expend effort and resources in helping our children reach goals that will help them to maintain a good standing with Jehovah .
It has been a great source of satisfaction not only to see our children reach spiritual goals but to share the journey with them . ”
Give examples of courage in the Christian congregation .
( a ) How can baptized brothers be courageous ?
( Read Philippians 2 : 13 ; 4 : 13 . )
We urge all baptized brothers to be courageous and work hard for the congregation !
Therefore , “ be courageous . . . and go to work . ”
1 , 2 . ( a ) What would life be like without the Bible ?
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 24 , 25 . )
( a ) How do languages change over time ?
( Read Revelation 14 : 6 , footnote . )
Later printings also used the word “ LORD ” in capital letters in some verses in the Christian Greek Scriptures .
Why are we grateful for the New World Translation ?

( Read Psalm 119 : 162 - 165 . )

See the box “ A Turning Point . ”
Take time to explain , illustrate , and apply verses that you read
“ A turning point came about 15 years after I was baptized .
During a talk at the Kingdom Hall . . . , the speaker referred to James 1 : 23 , 24 .
Those verses liken God’s Word to a mirror in which we can see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us .
I began to wonder if what I saw in myself was different from what Jehovah saw .
At first , I resisted this new idea .
I still felt that loving me was too much to expect of Jehovah .
“ A few days later , I read a scripture that changed my life .
I felt as if Jehovah were speaking to me , saying : ‘ Come on , Vicky , let’s set matters straight between us .
I know you , I know your sins , I know your heart ​ — and I love you . ’
“ I was unable to sleep that night .
I still doubted that Jehovah could love me , but I began thinking about Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
All of a sudden , it dawned on me that Jehovah had been patient with me for so long , showing me that he loved me in so many ways .
Yet , I was , in effect , saying to him : ‘ Your love is not great enough to reach me .
Your Son’s sacrifice is not enough to cover me . ’
It was as if I had been throwing the ransom back at Jehovah .
But now , at last , by meditating on this gift of the ransom , I began to feel loved by Jehovah . ”

Paul wrote that “ Christ has been raised from the dead , the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep in death . ”
What will happen to some anointed ones during Christ’s presence ?
For if we have faith that Jesus died and rose again , so too God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in death . . .
We the living who survive to the presence of the Lord will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep in death ; because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call , . . . and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first .
Anointed ones who are alive during the great tribulation will be “ caught away in clouds . ”
I was born on July 29 , 1929 , and grew up in a village in the province of Bulacan in the Philippines .

I can’t expect my children to be persuaded unless I am . ”

Then I continue with the point of my story .
The more I use this approach , the easier it gets .
And afterward , I always feel great ! ”
We are the only Witnesses they are exposed to .
So the way we act can determine how they will respond .
What if we are shy or timid or have a hard time speaking up about our faith , or what if we cringe when we do speak up ?
However , if we talk with ease and assurance about what we believe , making it a normal part of conversation , it’s more likely that they will respect us . ”
Jesus said : “ If anyone wants to come after me , let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and keep following me . ”
What lesson can we learn from Isaiah 40 : 26 ?

How does the organization use the money that is donated today ?
What do we show Jehovah when we support his work ?
( Read 2 Corinthians 8 : 18 - 21 . )
Your donations help our worldwide work ( See paragraphs 14 - 16 )
As a result , we sometimes feel isolated , and we easily forget the scope of Jehovah’s work .
But as soon as we watch the various programs on JW Broadcasting , we remember that we are part of an international brotherhood .
Our dear local brothers and sisters are very excited about JW Broadcasting .
We often hear them say that after watching the monthly programs , they feel close to the members of the Governing Body .
Now they are prouder than ever to be part of God’s organization . ”
( Read Proverbs 11 : 24 , 25 . )

( Read Daniel 6 : 7 - 10 . )
( Read Job 31 : 24 - 28 . )
( Read Psalm 11 : 5 ; 26 : 4 . )
So ask yourself , ‘ Do I know Jehovah as well as Noah , Daniel , and Job did ? ’
Noah’s great - grandfather Enoch also “ kept walking with the true God . ”
Jesus said : “ Abraham your father rejoiced greatly at the prospect of seeing my day . ”
It’s hard for me to express the joy we feel . ”
For it is to us God has revealed them through his spirit . ”
Jesus said : “ These things I have spoken to you , so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be made full . ”
( 3 ) How will our effort to have “ the mind of Christ ” help us to be spiritual people ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 - 16 . )

As a result , I did not dress very modestly .
But learning the truth moved me to make the needed effort to be a spiritual person .
Making changes was not easy , but I became happier and found real purpose in life . ”
So being like Jesus makes us more like Jehovah .
They said : “ We are witnesses of all the things he did . ”
How will having the mind of Christ affect your daily life ?
He says : “ I never did anything wrong , but I was just going through the motions .
I looked spiritually strong , being at all the meetings and serving as an auxiliary pioneer a few times a year .
He says : “ It was as if I knew nothing .
I thought to myself , ‘ If I am going to be my wife’s spiritual head , I have to do something . ’ ”

I got understanding and , most important , developed a close relationship with Jehovah . ”
( 3 ) How can strong spirituality help us in our daily life ?
( b ) What is our goal when we study and meditate ?
( b ) What Bible example can we imitate ?
12 , 13 . ( a ) What will help us to apply Romans 15 : 5 ?
( Read 2 Peter 1 : 5 - 8 . )

They wanted to make sure I knew how serious my decision was .
On December 31 , 1934 , the day came for this momentous event in my life . ”
5 , 6 . ( a ) The Bible’s description of Timothy leads us to what conclusion about his baptism ?
( Read Colossians 1 : 9 , 10 . )
He told Jehovah that he was so happy about his little girl’s decision to dedicate her life to Him . ”
( Read 1 Peter 3 : 20 , 21 . )
Why do we not pressure anyone to get baptized ?
If you are a parent , you may have asked yourself : ‘ Is my child really ready to get baptized ?
The first question is , “ On the basis of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ , have you repented of your sins and dedicated yourself to Jehovah to do his will ? ”
How can we be hospitable at our Christian meetings ?
( Read 3 John 5 - 8 . )
He writes : “ I hesitated initially because we were newly married and living in a small house .
But having students stay with us was truly a joyous experience .
As newlyweds , we were able to see how happy a couple can be when they serve Jehovah and pursue spiritual goals together . ”
Why may those who are new to your congregation need hospitality ?
( Read Luke 10 : 41 , 42 . )
One evening my wife was particularly homesick , and my efforts to help were not working .
Then , about 7 : 30 p.m . , we heard a knock on the door .
There stood a Bible student who brought us three oranges .
She had come to welcome the new missionaries .
We invited her in and gave her a glass of water .
If you feel anxious about having guests , you are not alone .
An elder in Britain admits : “ There can be a measure of nervousness in preparing for guests .
But as with anything in relation to serving Jehovah , the benefits and satisfaction that result far outweigh any anxiety .
I have enjoyed simply sitting down with guests over coffee and talking . ”
Another elder writes : “ Having friends from the congregation to my home helps me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
The wife of one of the instructors really put me at ease .
She said that when she and her husband are serving in the traveling work , their best weeks are those spent staying with a spiritual person who may not have much materially but who has the same focus as they have ​ — serving Jehovah and keeping life simple .
This reminded me of what my mum used to say to us as children : ‘ Better a dish of vegetables where there’s love . ’ ”
( Read Proverbs 25 : 21 , 22 . )
Hosts usually prepare well for their guests ( See paragraph 20 )
The psalmist David asked : “ O Jehovah , who may be a guest in your tent ? ”
It is also important to respect local customs .
Why is it so important to “ be hospitable to one another ” ?
Two brothers offer a tract to a painter on the bridge in front of Kaštilac , a fortress built in the 16th century , near the city of Split
( Read Titus 2 : 11 - 14 . )
The elder recalled : “ Graham had a problem with pride .
He was critical of the elders who had been involved in his disfellowshipping .
So for the next few studies , we discussed scriptures on pride and its effects .
Graham began to see himself clearly in the mirror of God’s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
After acknowledging that he had been blinded by a ‘ rafter ’ of pride and that his critical attitude was his problem , he began to change quickly for the better .
He started to attend Christian meetings regularly , to study God’s Word earnestly , and to make daily prayer a habit .
‘ I’ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I’ve even served as a pioneer .
The apostle Peter wrote : “ Shepherd the flock of God under your care , serving as overseers , not under compulsion , but willingly before God ; not for love of dishonest gain , but eagerly ; not lording it over those who are God’s inheritance , but becoming examples to the flock . ”
How can parents raise their children in the discipline of Jehovah ?
( Read Hebrews 12 : 5 - 11 . )
How does a child develop self - discipline ?
4 , 5 . ( a ) Why is self - discipline an important part of “ the new personality ” ?
How can we become better students of God’s Word ?
One brother wrote : “ I am filled with gratitude for the way my parents raised me .
( b ) How did one family benefit from the parents ’ obedience to Jehovah ?
Some years later , the daughter was reinstated .
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleasant for them ?
They did not berate me or criticize me , but they encouraged me and strengthened me .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how busy they were , at least one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel worthy of God’s love .
Time and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to confirm his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be restored to favor ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is crouching at the door , and its craving is to dominate you ; but will you get the mastery over it ? ”
So let us “ listen to discipline and become wise . ”
People around the world are demanding more freedom .
15 Imitating Jehovah ​ — A God Who Gives Encouragement
“ If the Son sets you free , you will be truly free . ” ​ — JOHN 8 : 36 .
( Read 1 Chronicles 29 : 11 , 12 . )
To enjoy the ‘ good , ’ humankind must trust God and obey him .
If they disobey , they will be left to decide for themselves what is good . . . and what is not good . ”
Like that pilot , Adam and Eve wanted to do things their own way .
He said : “ If you remain in my word , you are really my disciples , and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
Why can the freedom that Jesus promised make us “ truly free ” ?
( Read Romans 8 : 1 , 2 , 20 , 21 . )
( Look under INTERVIEWS AND EXPERIENCES > ENDURING TRIALS . )
All things are lawful , but not all things build up . ”
What example did Noah and his family set for us ?

( b ) How did Jehovah encourage his Son ?
Enter into the joy of your master . ”
How did Hezekiah encourage the military chiefs and the people of Judah ?
How did Peter ‘ strengthen his brothers ’ ?
But I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out ; and you , once you have returned , strengthen your brothers . ” ​ — Luke 22 : 31 , 32 .
Whom can we encourage today , and why ?
How can the elders give counsel in an encouraging way ?
She also shared with me her own experience with the kind of test I was going through , and I felt less alone . ”
King Solomon wrote : “ A word spoken at the right time ​ — how good it is !
A cheerful glance makes the heart rejoice ; a good report invigorates the bones . ”
For you have made me rejoice , O Jehovah , because of your deeds ; because of the works of your hands I shout joyfully . ”
The apostle Paul promised : “ God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name . ”
You are never too young to set goals .
Proverbs 21 : 5 says : “ The plans of the diligent surely lead to success . ”
The earlier you make plans by setting good goals , the sooner you will have success .
With a university degree in law , I could have earned a lot of money , but I would have had little chance of finding part - time work . ”
17 , 18 . ( a ) What does Jehovah want for young people today ?
“ Let your brotherly love continue . ” ​ — HEBREWS 13 : 1 .
What is brotherly love ?
Why is it so important to continue to show brotherly love ?
Why did Paul write a letter to the Hebrew Christians ?
IN THE year 61 , the congregations throughout Israel enjoyed relative peace .
Although the apostle Paul was in prison in Rome , he hoped to be released soon .
His traveling partner Timothy had just been freed from prison , and together they hoped to visit the brothers in Judea .
Earlier , Jesus had told his followers that as soon as they saw Jerusalem surrounded by soldiers , they would need to flee . ​ — Luke 21 : 20 - 24 .
It had been 28 years since Jesus gave his followers that warning .
During that time , the Christians in Israel remained faithful despite much persecution and many trials .
But Paul wanted to prepare them for what would happen in the future .
( Read Hebrews 10 : 36 - 39 . )
So Jehovah inspired Paul to write to those dear brothers and sisters .
That letter , now called the book of Hebrews , was designed to strengthen them for what would happen .
Why should we be interested in the book of Hebrews ?
As God’s people today , we should be interested in the book of Hebrews .
But most of us enjoy peaceful circumstances and do not experience direct persecution .
So , like the Christians in Paul’s time , we need to be alert .
Very soon , we will experience the biggest test of our faith ! ​ — Read Luke 21 : 34 - 36 .
What is the yeartext for 2016 , and why is it appropriate ?
What will help us to prepare for this future event ?
In the book of Hebrews , Paul stated many things that will help to strengthen our faith .
That verse has been selected to be the yeartext for 2016 .
Our yeartext for 2016 : “ Let your brotherly love continue . ” ​ — Hebrews 13 : 1
How do true Christians understand the meaning of brotherly love ?
For Jews in the past , the word “ brother ” usually referred to a relative and sometimes to a person outside the family .
But it would never include someone who was not Jewish .
However , as true Christians , our “ brother ” is any true Christian , no matter what country he or she comes from .
But why is it important to continue to show brotherly love ?
( a ) What is the most important reason for us to show brotherly love ?
( b ) Give another reason why it is important to strengthen our affection for one another .
The most important reason to show brotherly love is that Jehovah tells us to do so .
We cannot really love Jehovah if we refuse to love our brothers .
Jesus had described how difficult that time would be .
What do we need to do now before the start of the great tribulation ?
That is where we worship Jehovah with our brothers and sisters .
But we must do more than just meet together regularly .
( a ) What opportunities do we have to show brotherly love today ?
( b ) Give examples of how Jehovah’s people have shown brotherly love .
Many of our brothers suffer because of earthquakes , floods , hurricanes , tsunamis , or other natural disasters .
Some brothers endure persecution .
And there are daily economic difficulties as a result of living in this corrupt world .
Even though this world does not show love , we need to continue showing brotherly love . ​ — See endnote .
What will we now examine ?
After saying “ let your brotherly love continue , ” the apostle Paul listed several ways that Christians can do this .
What does it mean to show hospitality ?
“ Do not forget hospitality . ”
The word Paul used literally means “ kindness to strangers . ”
Those two men showed kindness to visitors they did not know .
We can invite our brothers and sisters to our home for a meal or for some encouragement .
We do not need to make a big meal or spend a lot of money .
And we should not invite only those who can repay us in some way .
What is most important is that we are never so busy that we forget to show hospitality !
How can we “ keep in mind those in prison ” ?
“ Keep in mind those in prison . ”
Paul commended the congregation because they had shown “ sympathy for those in prison . ”
Some brothers helped Paul during the four years he was in prison , but others lived far away .
How could they help Paul ?
They could keep praying intensely for him . ​ — Philippians 1 : 12 - 14 ; Hebrews 13 : 18 , 19 .
Brothers and sisters who live close by can help them with practical things .
But many of us live far from those in prison .
How can we help them and not forget them ?
Brotherly love will motivate us to pray intensely for them .
How can we honor our marriage ?
“ Let marriage be honorable among all . ”
We can also show brotherly love by being morally clean .
Think , too , about how a wife would feel if she discovered that her husband watches pornography .
How does contentment help us to show brotherly love ?
Be “ content with the present things . ”
When we are content , we will remember that our Christian brothers and sisters are much more important than money or things .
We will not complain about our brothers or about our situation in life .
Instead , when we are content , we will be generous . ​ — 1 Timothy 6 : 17 - 19 .
How does being “ of good courage ” help us to show brotherly love ?
Trust in Jehovah gives us the courage to endure difficult trials .
This courage helps us to have a positive attitude .
How can we strengthen our brotherly love for our elders ?
“ Remember those who are taking the lead . ”
When we think about all that they do , our love and appreciation for them grows .
Instead , we want to obey willingly .
This way we “ give them extraordinary consideration in love because of their work . ” ​ — 1 Thessalonians 5 : 13 .
Do you appreciate the work that elders do for us ?
How can we continue to show brotherly love in a greater way ?
Jehovah’s people are known for their brotherly love .
The same was true in Paul’s day .
Clearly , there is always room for improvement !
So as we look at our yeartext in our Kingdom Hall during this year , let us meditate on these questions : Can I be more hospitable ?
What will help me to be truly content ?
How can I be more obedient to those who are taking the lead ?
If we work to improve in these six areas , the yeartext will not be just a sign on the wall ; it will remind us to obey Paul’s words : “ Let your brotherly love continue . ” ​ — Hebrews 13 : 1 .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 9 ) For examples of how Jehovah’s Witnesses show brotherly love in times of disaster , see the July 15 , 2002 , Watchtower , pages 8 - 9 , and Jehovah’s Witnesses ​ — Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom , chapter 19 .

“ Thanks be to God for his indescribable free gift . ” ​ — 2 CORINTHIANS 9 : 15 .
SONGS : 121 , 63
What does Christ’s love motivate us to do ?
How does God’s love motivate us to love our brothers ?
Why should God’s forgiveness motivate us to forgive our brothers ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What does God’s “ indescribable free gift ” include ?
Paul knew that Jesus ’ sacrifice is a guarantee that all of God’s wonderful promises will come true .
( Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 20 . )
This means that God’s “ indescribable free gift ” includes Jesus ’ sacrifice and all the goodness and loyal love that Jehovah shows us .
3 , 4 . ( a ) How do you feel when someone gives you a gift ?
( b ) How might a special gift change your life ?
We love it when someone gives us a gift .
But some gifts are so meaningful or special that they can change our life .
But suddenly , someone you do not know volunteers to receive the punishment instead of you .
He is willing to die for you !
Such a loving and special gift would cause you to make changes in your life .
How is God’s gift of the ransom much greater than any other gift ?
God’s gift of the ransom is much greater than the gift in the example .
Love motivated Jehovah to send Jesus to the earth to die for all humans , to “ taste death for everyone . ”
But Jesus ’ sacrifice will do even more !
It will destroy death forever .
What other blessings are included in Jehovah’s gift ?
( a ) What blessings of Jehovah’s gift do you look forward to ?
( b ) Name three things God’s gift will motivate us to do .
As part of God’s gift , the earth will become a paradise , the sick will be cured , and the dead will be resurrected .
We love Jehovah and his dear Son for giving us this “ indescribable free gift . ”
How should we feel about the love of Christ , and what should it motivate us to do ?
Paul knew that if we accept Jesus ’ great love , it will compel us , or motivate us , to love and honor Jesus .
Yes , when we fully understand what Jehovah has done for us , his love will motivate us to live in a way that shows we honor Jesus .
In turn , whoever loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him and will clearly show myself to him . ” ​ — John 14 : 21 ; 1 John 5 : 3 .
What pressures do we have ?
During this Memorial season , it is good to meditate on how we are using our life .
So ask yourself : ‘ In what areas do I already imitate Jesus ?
In what areas can I improve ? ’
If we are not careful , we could feel pressured to start imitating the world’s teachers , celebrities , and sports heroes .
What questions can we ask ourselves during this Memorial season , and what may the answers motivate us to do ?
It is good to take time during the Memorial season to examine our clothes , movies , and music , as well as what is on our computer , cell phone , or tablet .
( Read 1 Timothy 2 : 9 , 10 . )
Would Jesus like to watch my movies ?
If Jesus borrowed my cell phone or tablet , would I be embarrassed by what he saw ?
( a ) How does our love for Jehovah and Jesus motivate us in the preaching work ?
( b ) How can our love motivate us to help others in the congregation ?
Our love for Jesus motivates us to preach and teach with zeal .
During the Memorial season , can you arrange your daily life so that you can auxiliary pioneer and spend 30 or 50 hours in the preaching work ?
But the pioneers in his area wanted to help him .
Can you help someone in your congregation to auxiliary pioneer in March or April ?
If we do so , we will show that we , like Paul , are motivated by Jesus ’ love .
What else will God’s love move us to do ?
The apostle John wrote : “ Beloved ones , if this is how God loved us , then we are also under obligation to love one another . ”
So if we accept God’s love , we need to love our brothers .
What example did Jesus set in loving others ?
Jesus ’ example shows us how we can love others .
When he was on earth , he helped people , especially the humble ones .
He loved those humble people and worked hard to help them . ​ — Matthew 20 : 28 .
Can you help an older brother or sister in the ministry ?
( See paragraph 14 )
What can you do to show love for your brothers ?
( Read Luke 14 : 12 - 14 . )
Let God’s love motivate you to show love for your brothers !
What must we recognize ?
Third , Jehovah’s love motivates us to forgive our brothers and sisters .
All of us have inherited sin and death from Adam , so no one can say , “ I do not need the ransom . ”
Even the most faithful servant of God needs the gift of the ransom .
Each of us has been forgiven a huge debt !
We find the answer in one of Jesus ’ illustrations .
16 , 17 . ( a ) What should we learn from Jesus ’ illustration of the king and the slaves ?
( b ) After meditating on Jesus ’ illustration , what are you determined to do ?
But later , that slave did not forgive a fellow slave a much smaller debt of only 100 denarii .
The king’s mercy should have motivated his slave to forgive a fellow slave .
The king was furious when he heard that his slave did not forgive such a small debt .
Should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I showed mercy to you ? ”
Like the king , Jehovah has forgiven us a huge debt .
What should Jehovah’s love and mercy motivate us to do ?
As we prepare for the Memorial , we might ask ourselves : ‘ Have I been hurt by a brother ?
Do I find it difficult to forgive him ? ’
If so , this is a good time to imitate Jehovah , who is “ ready to forgive . ”
If we do not love and forgive our brothers , we cannot expect Jehovah to love and forgive us .
When we forgive others , it does not change the fact that they hurt us , but it will help us to have a happier future .
How did God’s love help one sister to put up with the imperfections of another sister ?
It can be difficult to put up with the imperfections of our brothers and sisters .
Even though helping Carol was difficult for Lily , she says : “ I look forward to seeing Carol in the resurrection .
I want to know her when she is perfect . ”
How will God’s “ indescribable free gift ” motivate you ?
Jehovah has truly given us an “ indescribable free gift . ”
May their love motivate us to imitate Jesus closely , to show love for our brothers , and to forgive our brothers from the heart .

What events made Pentecost a special day , and how did those events fulfill what the Scriptures had foretold ?
Then , at about nine o’clock , he offered two leavened loaves made from the first wheat , or the firstfruits , of the harvest .
The high priest waved the loaves from side to side to present them to Jehovah .
This was Pentecost of the year 33 . ​ — Leviticus 23 : 15 - 20 .
Every year , for hundreds of years , the high priest made this wave offering .
The offering was closely related to something very important that happened on Pentecost of the year 33 .
And it happened to 120 disciples of Jesus who were praying together in an upper room in Jerusalem .
Eight hundred years earlier , the prophet Joel had written about this event .
Read Acts 2 : 2 - 4 .
On Pentecost of the year 33 , God gave those Christians his holy spirit , and they were anointed .
Then , he told the crowd : “ Repent , and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins , and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit . ”
( a ) Why should we be interested in what happened at Pentecost ?
( b ) What other important event may have happened on the same day many years earlier ?
What did the high priest and the offering he made every Pentecost represent ?
The high priest represented Jesus .
Those disciples have been chosen from among sinful humans and are called “ firstfruits . ”
God has accepted these ones as his sons and has chosen them to rule as kings with Jesus in heaven as part of God’s Kingdom .
How do we know that not all those who are anointed receive their anointing in exactly the same way ?
Each of them had what looked like a flame on his head .
Jehovah gave them the ability to speak in a foreign language .
They had no doubt that they were anointed by holy spirit .
For example , the Bible does not say that something that looked like a flame appeared on the heads of the thousands in Jerusalem who were anointed later that day .
The Samaritans were anointed sometime after their baptism .
And in an unusual case , Cornelius and those in his house were anointed before they were baptized . ​ — Acts 10 : 44 - 48 .
What do all anointed ones receive , and how does this affect them ?
Clearly , Christians realize in different ways that they are anointed .
Some may have realized right away that Jehovah anointed them .
So Jehovah uses his holy spirit to make it absolutely clear to these Christians that he has chosen them to go to heaven .
What must each anointed Christian do to receive his reward in heaven ?
Peter explained it this way : “ Therefore , brothers , be all the more diligent to make your calling and choosing sure for yourselves , for if you keep on doing these things , you will by no means ever fail . In fact , in this way you will be richly granted entrance into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . ”
So each anointed Christian must not let anything stop him from serving Jehovah .
Even though he has been invited , or called , to go to heaven , if he does not stay faithful , he will not get his reward . ​ — Hebrews 3 : 1 ; Revelation 2 : 10 .
8 , 9 . ( a ) Why is it difficult for most people to understand what happens when someone is anointed ?
( b ) How does a person know that he has been invited to go to heaven ?
Most of God’s servants today may find it difficult to understand what happens to someone when God anoints him .
So when he anoints them , their hope and the way they think change , so that they look forward to life in heaven . ​ — Read Ephesians 1 : 18 .
Notice what Paul said to the anointed brothers in Rome , who were “ called to be holy ones . ”
He told them : “ You did not receive a spirit of slavery causing fear again , but you received a spirit of adoption as sons , by which spirit we cry out : ‘ Abba , Father ! ’
By means of his holy spirit , God makes it clear to someone that he or she is invited to rule as a king in heaven with Jesus . ​ — 1 Thessalonians 2 : 12 .
What does 1 John 2 : 27 mean when it says that an anointed Christian does not need someone else to teach him ?
Those who receive this invitation from God do not need anyone else to tell them that they have been anointed .
Jehovah makes them feel convinced .
The apostle John tells anointed Christians : “ You have an anointing from the holy one , and all of you have knowledge . ”
Just as it has taught you , remain in union with him . ”
Anointed Christians need to be taught by Jehovah just like everyone else .
But they do not need anyone to confirm that they are anointed .
Jehovah has used the most powerful force , his holy spirit , to make it absolutely clear to them that they are !
What might an anointed Christian wonder , but what does he never doubt ?
When Christians are anointed by holy spirit , they change very much .
The wind blows where it wants to , and you hear the sound of it , but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going . So it is with everyone who has been born from the spirit . ”
Someone who has been anointed does not doubt that Jehovah has chosen him
He may even wonder if he is good enough for this responsibility .
But he does not doubt that Jehovah has chosen him .
Instead , he feels extremely happy and is very grateful for such a gift .
How does the way a person thinks change when he is anointed by holy spirit , and what causes this change ?
Did they change because they felt depressed or suffered a lot ?
Or did they want to experience what it would be like to live in heaven ?
How do anointed ones feel about their life here on earth ?
So does this mean that anointed ones want to die ?
These Christians do not want to die .
They enjoy life and want to use each day to serve Jehovah with their family and friends .
But no matter what they are doing , they remember what God has promised them for the future . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 53 ; 2 Peter 1 : 4 ; 1 John 3 : 2 , 3 ; Revelation 20 : 6 .
What does not prove that a person has been anointed by holy spirit ?
If you feel that he might have , think about these important questions : Do you feel that you are especially zealous in the preaching work ?
Do you really enjoy studying the Bible and learning “ the deep things of God ” ?
Do you feel that Jehovah has given you wonderful results in the preaching work ?
Do you have deep love for others and feel a great responsibility to help them serve Jehovah ?
Have you seen proof that Jehovah has helped you in many specific ways in your life ?
In fact , if you are wondering whether you will go to heaven , it means that you have not been invited .
How do we know that not all those who have received God’s spirit have been invited to go to heaven ?
Jesus said that there was no man greater than John , but then he said that John would not rule as a king in heaven .
David too was guided by holy spirit .
Holy spirit helped him to understand deep things about Jehovah and also directed him to write parts of the Bible .
Even so , the apostle Peter said that David “ did not ascend to the heavens . ”
It simply means that Jehovah will bring them back to life in Paradise on earth . ​ — John 5 : 28 , 29 ; Acts 24 : 15 .
17 , 18 . ( a ) What reward do most of God’s servants look forward to today ?
Like Abraham , David , John the Baptist , and many other men and women in Bible times , they look forward to living on earth when God’s government will rule over them .
There will be 144,000 ruling with Jesus in heaven .
But the Bible speaks of “ the remaining ones ” of the anointed who are still on earth in this time of the end .
If someone in your congregation starts to eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial , how should you treat him ?
We will answer these questions in the next article .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 4 ) The Festival of Pentecost was possibly celebrated at the same time of the year that the Law was given to Moses at Sinai .
So perhaps Moses brought the nation of Israel into the Law covenant on the same day of the year that Jesus brought anointed ones into the new covenant .
“ We want to go with you , for we have heard that God is with you people . ” ​ — ZECHARIAH 8 : 23 .
SONGS : 65 , 122
How is Zechariah 8 : 23 being fulfilled ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What did Jehovah say would happen in our time ?
( b ) What questions will be answered in this article ?
The “ Jew ” represents those whom God has anointed by holy spirit .
They are also called “ the Israel of God . ”
But Jesus said that they would all be “ one flock ” and would follow him , their “ one shepherd . ”
( 3 ) If someone in my congregation starts to eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial , how should I treat him ?
( 4 ) Do I need to worry when I see the number of those who eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial going up ?
Why is it not possible for us to know for sure who will be part of the 144,000 ?
Because it is not possible for anyone to know for sure that these ones will get their reward .
Jehovah gives this final approval , or final sealing , either before they die or just before the start of “ the great tribulation . ” ​ — Revelation 2 : 10 ; 7 : 3 , 14 .
The Bible verse mentions one Jew .
What warning should anointed ones think seriously about , and why ?
Anointed ones should think seriously about the warning found at 1 Corinthians 11 : 27 - 29 .
How might an anointed one eat the bread and drink the wine “ unworthily ” at the Memorial ?
This strong warning reminds anointed ones that they must stay faithful if they want to receive “ the prize of the upward call of God by means of Christ Jesus . ” ​ — Philippians 3 : 13 - 16 .
How should they do this ?
Jehovah’s holy spirit helps his servants to be humble , not proud .
So anointed ones do not think that they are better than others .
And they do not feel that they can understand Bible truths more deeply than anyone else .
What do anointed Christians not expect , and why ?
Although anointed ones feel that it is an honor to be invited to go to heaven , they do not expect others to treat them in a special way .
Anointed Christians do not feel that they should spend time only with other anointed ones , as if they were members of a club .
They do not try to find other anointed ones so that they can talk about being anointed or meet in groups to study the Bible .
The congregation would not be united if anointed ones did this .
Why do you need to be careful about the way you treat those who eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial ?
( See the box “ Love ‘ Does Not Behave Indecently . ’ ” )
How should you treat anointed brothers and sisters ?
Jesus told his disciples : “ All of you are brothers . ”
He continued : “ Whoever exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted . ”
So it would be wrong to admire a person too much , even if he is an anointed brother of Christ .
But this is because they “ preside in a fine way ” and “ work hard in speaking and teaching , ” not because they are anointed .
How should you treat someone who eats the bread and drinks the wine at the Memorial ?
( See paragraphs 9 - 11 )
How can you show that you respect anointed Christians ?
How can we show that we respect those who are anointed by Jehovah ?
We would not ask them how they became anointed .
And we should not think that their husband or wife , their parents , or other family members are also anointed .
A person does not inherit his hope from his family .
We should also avoid asking questions that could hurt others .
After all , we can be absolutely sure that in the new world , Jehovah will “ satisfy the desire of every living thing . ” ​ — Psalm 145 : 16 .
How do we protect ourselves if we avoid “ admiring personalities ” ?
If we do not treat anointed ones as more important than others , we also protect ourselves .
But if we avoid “ admiring personalities , ” we will never follow others , even those who are anointed or well - known or those who have served Jehovah for a long time .
Then , if they become unfaithful or leave the congregation , we will not lose our faith in Jehovah or stop serving him . ​ — Jude 16 , footnote .
Why should we not worry about the number of those who eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial ?
For many years , the number of those who ate the bread and drank the wine at the Memorial kept going down .
But recently , that number has been going up every year .
“ Jehovah knows those who belong to him . ”
So the number includes those who think that they are anointed but are not .
Others may have mental or emotional problems and believe that they will rule with Christ in heaven .
Clearly , we do not know exactly how many anointed ones are left on earth .
What does the Bible say about the number of anointed ones who will be on earth when the great tribulation starts ?
There will be anointed ones in many parts of the earth when Jesus comes to take them to heaven .
The Bible says that Jesus “ will send out his angels with a great trumpet sound , and they will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds , from one extremity of the heavens to their other extremity . ”
The Bible also shows that during the last days , there will be a small number of anointed ones left on earth .
But it does not say how many of them will be left when the great tribulation begins .
What do we need to understand about the 144,000 chosen by Jehovah ?
For hundreds of years after that , most of those who said that they were Christians did not really follow Christ .
Even so , during those years , Jehovah anointed those few who were true Christians .
They were like the wheat that Jesus said would grow among the weeds .
During the last days , Jehovah has continued to choose people who will be part of the 144,000 .
So if God decides to choose some of these just before the end , surely we would not doubt that he is doing the right thing .
Only a few anointed Christians in the first century were used to write the Christian Greek Scriptures .
And today , only a few anointed Christians have the responsibility to give God’s people “ food at the proper time . ”
All must stay humble .
All must serve him together and be united .
[ 2 ] ( paragraph 15 ) Although Acts 2 : 33 shows that Jesus is involved when someone is anointed , Jehovah is the one who invites that person .
Instead , when we love our brothers , we think about their feelings before we say or do something .
We can show that we love those taking the lead in Jehovah’s organization by the way we treat them .
At times , well - known brothers might visit our congregation or the convention we attend .
Naturally , we want to show them and their wives respect , and this is good .
But even if we welcome these brothers , could it be that we are still not showing them respect ?
Although we enjoy meeting and talking with the brothers and sisters who visit us , we would not show them respect if we treated them as celebrities .
For example , would it show good manners if we take photos of them without their permission or when they are not aware of it , perhaps when they are eating or doing something else ?
Would we push in front of others and insist that we have a photo taken with them ?
What effect could such behavior have on those attending one of our conventions for the first time ?
Instead , we show them respect because we understand why they are visiting us and how hard they work for us .
What will help us to know how to treat our brothers ?
First , remember that we should give glory to Jehovah .
Second , realize that while it is good to respect these brothers and their wives , we would not want to treat them as celebrities .
They want to be treated as our brothers and sisters .
If we remember these things , we will show love and “ not behave indecently . ”
The ten men “ go with ” the Jew : The other sheep serve Jehovah with anointed ones but do not think of them as their leaders or give them too much praise and attention .
Instead , the other sheep love and respect anointed ones and treat them as their brothers and sisters
“ Working together with him , we also urge you not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose . ” ​ — 2 CORINTHIANS 6 : 1 .
brings us happiness ?
draws us closer to God and to others ?
Even though Jehovah is the Supreme One , what has he invited others to do ?
JEHOVAH is the Supreme One .
He created everything , and he has unlimited wisdom and power .
After he helped Job understand this , Job said to him : “ I know that you are able to do all things and that nothing you have in mind to do is impossible for you . ”
Jehovah can do whatever he decides to do without help from anyone .
But he shows love by inviting others to work together with him to accomplish his purpose .
What important work did Jehovah invite Jesus to do ?
Then , Jehovah allowed his Son to help him create all other things .
What did Jehovah invite Adam to do , and why ?
Jehovah also invited humans to work together with him .
For example , he allowed Adam to name the animals .
Imagine the joy Adam felt doing this work !
He carefully studied the way the animals looked and acted , and then he chose a name for each one of them .
How did others work with God to accomplish his will ?
Later , God invited other people to work with him .
Noah built an ark that kept him and his family alive during the Flood .
Moses freed the nation of Israel from Egypt .
Joshua led the Israelites into the Promised Land .
Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem .
All these faithful ones and many others worked with Jehovah to accomplish his will .
In what work can we share , and did Jehovah need to involve us in this work ?
Today , Jehovah invites us to do all we can to support his Kingdom .
There are many ways we can serve God .
He could have spoken directly from heaven to people on earth .
The apostle Paul wrote : “ Working together with him , we also urge you not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose . ”
It is a great honor to be invited to work with God .
Let us see some reasons why this brings us great joy .
How did God’s firstborn Son describe how he felt about working beside his Father ?
Working with God has always made Jehovah’s servants happy .
When Jesus worked with his Father , he was happy because he accomplished many things and he knew that Jehovah loved him .
Why does the preaching work bring us joy ?
Jesus said that we are happy both when we give and when we receive .
It brought us joy when we received the truth , but why does it also bring us joy to share the truth with others ?
The preaching work is the most important and the most satisfying work we could be doing .
It makes it possible for those who become God’s friends to have everlasting life . ​ — 2 Corinthians 5 : 20 .
What have some said about the joy of working with Jehovah ?
This also gives us joy .
Marco , who lives in Italy , says : “ I have the priceless joy of knowing that I am giving my best to Jehovah and not to someone who will soon forget what I’ve done . ”
Similarly , Franco , who also serves in Italy , says : “ By means of his Word and his spiritual provisions , Jehovah reminds us every day that he loves us and that everything we do for him is important , even though our efforts may seem like nothing to us .
This is why working along with God makes me happy and gives my life meaning . ”
What relationship existed between Jehovah and Jesus , and why ?
Jesus worked with Jehovah for perhaps billions of years .
Jesus explained how close that relationship was when he said : “ I and the Father are one . ”
They were truly united , and they fully cooperated when they worked together .
Why does preaching draw us closer to God and to others ?
He prayed : “ So that they may be one just as we are one . ”
We learn why it is wise to trust in him and to follow his direction .
And when we draw close to God , he draws close to us .
( Read James 4 : 8 . )
We also draw close to our brothers and sisters because we experience similar problems and joys and because we have the same goals .
We work together , rejoice together , and endure together .
Octavia , who lives in Britain , says : “ Working with Jehovah draws me closer to others . ”
She explains that it is because her friendships are now based on “ a common goal and direction . ”
Surely , we feel the same way .
When we see the efforts our brothers make to please Jehovah , it draws us closer to them .
Why will we draw even closer to Jehovah and to our brothers in the new world ?
Our love for God and our brothers is strong now , but it will be even stronger in the new world .
Think of all the exciting work we will do in the future !
We will also work to make the earth into a paradise .
All humans will draw even closer to one another and to Jehovah , who will surely “ satisfy the desire of every living thing . ” ​ — Psalm 145 : 16 .
We need to protect our relationship with Jehovah .
So we must use all our strength to swim in the other direction .
Similarly , we need to work hard to avoid being influenced by Satan’s world .
So how does preaching protect us ?
When we talk about Jehovah and the Bible , we focus on things that are important and good , not on things that will weaken our faith .
How does one Witness in Australia feel about preaching ?
When we keep busy preaching , studying , and doing things for others in the congregation , we are protected because we do not have time to worry too much about our own problems .
The preaching work helps me to try to stay humble ; it gives me an opportunity to rely on Jehovah and on my brothers and sisters . ”
Why does our perseverance in preaching show that God’s spirit is with us ?
Preaching also gives us more confidence that God’s spirit is with us .
To illustrate : Imagine that it is your job to give bread to the people in your community .
You do not get paid to do this , and you have to pay for your expenses .
Also , most people do not want the bread , and some even hate you for bringing it to them .
How long would you continue to work at such a job ?
Yet , many of us continue in the preaching work year after year , even though this costs us time and money and even though people make fun of us or get angry with us .
This proves that God’s spirit is helping us .
How is the preaching of the good news connected with God’s purpose for humankind ?
God’s purpose was that humans live forever , and his purpose did not change when Adam sinned .
God made an arrangement for us to be freed from sin and death .
Jesus came to earth and sacrificed his life .
When we preach and help others to become God’s friends today , we are working directly with God in his loving arrangement to save humans from sin and death .
How is our preaching linked to God’s greatest commandments ?
When we help others find the way to everlasting life , we show that we love them and we love Jehovah .
His “ will is that all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth . ”
When a Pharisee asked Jesus what was God’s greatest commandment , Jesus said : “ ‘ You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind . ’
How do you feel about the honor to preach the good news ?
It also gives us the opportunity to show our love for God and for others .
Jehovah has millions of servants around the world , and all of them have very different circumstances .
I give you my strength , my Word the Bible , heavenly support , earthly companions , progressive training , and precise instructions at the appropriate time . ’
What an immense privilege it is to do what Jehovah asks of us and to work together with our God ! ”
We are working together with God when we preach to others and help them to become his friends so that they can live forever .
Even though God could do this work by himself , he shows us love by inviting us to work with him .
In the first article , we will learn from the example of Abraham .
In the second , we will learn from the examples of Ruth , Hezekiah , and Jesus ’ mother , Mary .
In these articles , we will discuss some Bible accounts about King David and others who lived in his time .
By considering their examples , we will learn how we can stay loyal to Jehovah even in difficult situations .
26 Life Story ​ — Jehovah Has Given Me Success in His Service
30 Keep On Serving Jehovah With Joy
I told the officer that I had already been in prison because I would not fight .
I asked him , “ Are you going to make me go through that again ? ”
I WAS born in 1926 in Crooksville , Ohio , in the United States .
Father and Mother were not religious , but they told us eight children to go to church .
I went to the Methodist Church .
When I was 14 , the minister gave me a prize because I went to church every Sunday for a year .
Margaret Walker ( second sister from the left ) helped me learn the truth
About that time , a neighbor named Margaret Walker , one of Jehovah’s Witnesses , began visiting my mother and talking to her about the Bible .
Mother thought that I would interfere with her study , so she told me to get out of the house .
But I kept trying to listen to their discussions .
After a couple more visits , Margaret asked me , “ Do you know what God’s name is ? ”
I said , “ Everyone knows that ​ — it’s God . ”
She said , “ Get your Bible and look up Psalm 83 : 18 . ”
I did , and I discovered that God’s name is Jehovah .
I ran out to my friends and told them , “ When you get home tonight , look up Psalm 83 : 18 in the Bible and see what God’s name is . ”
You might say I started witnessing right away .
I studied the Bible and got baptized in 1941 .
Soon afterward , I was assigned to conduct a congregation book study .
I encouraged my mother and siblings to come , and they all began attending the book study that I conducted .
Dad , though , was not interested .
I was given more responsibility in the congregation , and I collected many books published by Jehovah’s Witnesses .
One day , Dad pointed to my books and said : “ You see all that stuff ?
I want it out of this house , and you can go with it . ”
Sometimes when she was on her way , he chased after her and pulled her back into the house .
But she would just run out the other door and go to the meeting .
I told Mother : “ Don’t worry .
He’ll get tired of running after you . ”
I reported to Fort Hayes in Columbus , Ohio , had a physical examination , and filled out paperwork .
I also told the officials that I would not become a soldier .
But a few days later , an officer came to my door and told me , “ Corwin Robison , I have a warrant for your arrest . ”
In court two weeks later , the judge said : “ If it were up to me , I’d give you a life sentence .
Do you have anything to say ? ”
I replied : “ Your Honor , I should have been classified as a minister .
Everyone’s doorstep is my pulpit , and I have preached the good news of the Kingdom to many people . ”
The judge told the jury : “ You are not here to decide whether this young man is a minister or not .
You are here to decide whether he reported for induction into the army or not . ”
In less than half an hour , the jury decided that I was guilty .
The judge sentenced me to five years in prison in Ashland , Kentucky .
I spent the first two weeks in a prison in Columbus , Ohio , and I stayed in my cell the first day .
I prayed to Jehovah : “ I cannot stay in a cell for five years .
The next day , the guards let me out .
I walked over to a tall , broad - shouldered prisoner , and we stood there looking out a window .
He asked me , “ What are you in for , Shorty ? ”
I said , “ I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses . ”
He said , “ You are ?
So why are you here ? ”
I said , “ Jehovah’s Witnesses don’t go to war and kill people . ”
He said , “ They put you in prison because you won’t kill people .
I said , “ No , it doesn’t . ”
Then he said , “ For 15 years I was in another prison , where I read some of your literature . ”
When I heard that , I prayed , “ Jehovah , help me get this man on my side . ”
So while I was there , I had no problems with the 50 prisoners in that section .
I was among the Witnesses imprisoned for neutrality at Ashland , Kentucky
When the officials moved me to the prison in Ashland , I met some mature brothers who were already there .
They helped me and others to remain close to Jehovah .
There was a brother who would organize our territory .
He would tell me : “ Robison , you are responsible for bed such and such .
Anyone assigned to that bed is your territory .
That is how we preached in an organized way .
World War II ended in 1945 , but I stayed in prison for some time after that .
I said , “ That’s fine , but I am not going into the army . ”
I quoted 2 Timothy 2 : 3 and said , “ I am already a soldier of Christ . ”
After a long silence , he said , “ You can leave . ”
Soon afterward , I attended the Bethel meeting at a convention in Cincinnati , Ohio .
Brother Milton Henschel told us that there was a need at Bethel for brothers who wanted to work hard for the Kingdom .
I applied for Bethel service and was accepted .
I have always had a lot of work at Bethel .
For several years , I operated the boilers in the printery and the office buildings , worked as a machinist , and repaired locks .
I also worked at Assembly Halls in New York City .
I love the programs at Bethel , such as morning worship and the family Watchtower Study , as well as preaching with the congregation .
When you think about it , these are things that any family of Jehovah’s Witnesses should be doing regularly .
When parents and children consider the daily text together , have regular Family Worship sessions , participate in the congregation meetings , and are zealous for preaching the good news , all in the family will likely remain close to Jehovah .
I have made many friends at Bethel and in the congregation .
But all of Jehovah’s servants are imperfect , including Bethelites .
If I have an argument with a brother , I always try to make peace .
Now I have a hard time preaching from door to door because of my age , but I have not given up .
I have learned a little Mandarin Chinese and enjoy approaching Chinese people on the street .
Some mornings I place 30 or 40 magazines with interested ones .
Preaching to the Chinese people in Brooklyn , New York
I have even made a return visit in China !
One day , a nice young girl smiled at me as she passed out advertisements for a fruit stand .
I smiled and offered her The Watchtower and Awake !
in Chinese .
She took them and told me that her name was Katie .
After that , whenever she saw me , Katie came over to talk to me .
I taught her the names of fruits and vegetables in English , and she repeated the words after me .
I also explained Bible texts to her , and she accepted the Bible Teach book .
After some weeks , though , she disappeared .
Months later , I offered the magazines to another girl who was passing out advertisements , and she accepted them .
The next week , she handed me her cell phone and said , “ You talk to China . ”
I said , “ I don’t know anybody in China . ”
But she insisted , so I took the phone and said , “ Hello , this is Robison . ”
The voice at the other end said , “ Robby , this is Katie .
I’m back in China . ”
Robby , you know that girl who handed you the phone ? She’s my sister .
Please teach her the way you taught me . ”
I said , “ Katie , I will do the best I can .
Thanks for letting me know where you are . ”
Soon afterward , I spoke to Katie’s sister for the last time .
Wherever those two girls are now , I hope that they learn more about Jehovah .
I have served Jehovah for 73 years , and I am happy that he helped me to remain neutral and to be faithful in prison .
Also , my siblings tell me that they were encouraged when I faced Dad’s opposition without giving up .
Even Dad’s attitude changed a little , and he attended some meetings before he passed away .
If it is God’s will , my family members and friends who have died will return to life in the new world .
* ​ — See footnote .
While this article was being prepared for publication , Corwin Robison died faithful to Jehovah .
“ You , O Israel , are my servant , you , O Jacob , whom I have chosen , the offspring of Abraham my friend . ” ​ — ISAIAH 41 : 8 .

How did knowledge and experience strengthen Abraham’s faith ?
What did Abraham do to strengthen his friendship with God ?
How can you imitate Abraham in building a friendship with Jehovah ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How do we know that humans can become God’s friends ?
FROM the moment we are born to the moment we die , we need love .
Humans need close and loving friendships , not just romantic love .
Many people do not believe that humans can have a close and loving friendship with God because he is invisible and almighty .
We should learn from their examples .
So let us consider the example of Abraham .
( Read James 2 : 23 . )
How did he become God’s friend ?
Abraham’s close friendship with God was based on faith , and he is known as “ the father of all those having faith . ”
As you consider his example , ask yourself , ‘ How can I imitate Abraham’s faith and strengthen my friendship with Jehovah ? ’
3 , 4 . ( a ) Describe what was likely Abraham’s greatest test of faith . ( b ) Why was Abraham willing to sacrifice Isaac ?
Imagine Abraham at about 125 years of age walking slowly up a mountain .
Behind him was his son Isaac , who was about 25 years old .
Isaac carried firewood , and Abraham carried a knife and the things needed to start a fire .
Instead , that journey was difficult because Jehovah had asked him to sacrifice his son ! ​ — Genesis 22 : 1 - 8 .
Abraham did not blindly obey God , that is , obey him without thinking
That was probably the greatest test of Abraham’s faith .
Some people say that God was cruel for asking Abraham to sacrifice his son .
He knew that Jehovah would never ask him to do anything that would cause permanent harm .
How may Abraham have learned about Jehovah , and how did that knowledge make him feel ?
Knowledge .
Abraham grew up in a city called Ur .
Shem was a man of great faith , and he probably talked to his relatives about Jehovah .
How did Abraham’s experiences strengthen his faith ?
Experience .
Some say that thoughts lead to feelings and feelings lead to actions .
The Bible calls such deep respect “ godly fear . ”
In order to have a close friendship with God , we need to have godly fear .
It was that quality that motivated Abraham to obey Jehovah .
They were no longer young , and they would have to live in tents for the rest of their lives .
Even though Abraham knew that there would be many dangers , he was determined to obey Jehovah .
Because of his obedience , God blessed and protected him .
For example , when Abraham’s beautiful wife , Sarah , was taken away from him and he was in danger of being killed , Jehovah miraculously protected both Abraham and Sarah more than once .
How can we gain knowledge and experience that will strengthen our friendship with Jehovah ?
Like Abraham , we need to learn about Jehovah .
And we too can gain the knowledge and experience we need .
This love and respect for God motivates us to obey him .
When we do , we see how he protects and blesses us , and this gives us experience that makes our faith stronger .
9 , 10 . ( a ) What is needed for a friendship to become stronger ?
( b ) What shows that Abraham cherished and strengthened his friendship with Jehovah ?
( Read Proverbs 17 : 17 . )
It is not like an expensive vase that is used only for decoration .
It is more like a beautiful flower that needs water and care to bloom .
Abraham cherished and maintained his friendship with Jehovah .
For example , when he traveled to Canaan with his family and his servants , he continued to let Jehovah guide him in making decisions both big and small .
A year before Isaac was born , when Abraham was 99 years old , Jehovah told him to circumcise all the males in his household .
Did Abraham doubt Jehovah or try to find an excuse for not doing what he was asked ?
Why was Abraham concerned about Sodom and Gomorrah , and how did Jehovah help him ?
For example , when Jehovah said that he would destroy the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah , Abraham was concerned .
He was afraid that good people would die along with the bad .
He was probably worried about his nephew Lot and his family , who lived in Sodom .
Jehovah was patient with his friend and showed him that He is merciful .
12 , 13 . ( a ) How did Abraham’s knowledge and experience help him later ?
( b ) What shows that Abraham had confidence in Jehovah ?
It is clear that all the knowledge and experience Abraham had gained helped him to keep his friendship with Jehovah strong .
Before leaving his servants , Abraham said : “ You stay here with the donkey , but the boy and I will go over there and worship and return to you . ”
What did Abraham mean ?
Was he lying about coming back with Isaac , knowing that he would sacrifice him ?
The Bible says that Abraham knew that Jehovah was able to resurrect Isaac from the dead .
Abraham knew that Jehovah had given him the power to have a son even though he and Sarah were very old .
So he realized that nothing was impossible for Jehovah .
Abraham did not know what would happen that day .
That is why Abraham is called “ the father of all those having faith . ”
What challenges do you face in serving Jehovah , and how may Abraham’s example help you ?
Sometimes we may not understand the reason for these commands or we may find them hard to obey .
For some , the preaching work is difficult .
Maybe they are shy and find it hard to talk to people they do not know .
When we meditate on examples of faithful men and women , it can motivate us to imitate them and to draw closer to our Friend , Jehovah . ​ — Hebrews 12 : 1 , 2 .
WHILE LIVING IN UR
Abraham and Sarah come to know and worship Jehovah
Abraham obeys God and leaves Ur
Jehovah protects Abraham and Sarah during their journey
LIFE IN CANAAN
Abraham is obedient and circumcises all males of his household
Jehovah patiently listens to Abraham’s concerns about Sodom
Jehovah makes it possible for Abraham and Sarah to have a son
Abraham dies “ at a good old age , old and satisfied ”
Why may we be sure that Abraham never regretted his loyal obedience to Jehovah ?
The Bible says that Abraham “ died at a good old age , old and satisfied . ”
However , when we read that Abraham was “ old and satisfied , ” this does not mean that he had no desire to live in the future .
What joys will Abraham experience in Paradise ?
The Bible says that Abraham “ was awaiting the city having real foundations , whose designer and builder is God . ”
Abraham believed that one day he would see that city , the Kingdom of God , ruling over the earth .
In Paradise he will find out that the sacrifice on Mount Moriah illustrated something much greater .
And he will learn how the pain he felt when he prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac has helped millions of faithful people to understand Jehovah’s pain when he gave his Son , Jesus Christ , as a ransom for mankind .
What is your determination , and what will we consider in the following article ?
May each of us be determined to imitate the faith of Abraham .
Like him , we need knowledge and experience .
In the following article , we will consider three more examples of faithful ones who became close friends of God .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 3 ) Abraham and Sarah were originally called Abram and Sarai .
But in this article , we will use the names that Jehovah later gave them .
As we learn about him , we will begin to have deep love and respect for him .
SONGS : 106 , 118
What can we learn from the friendship with God that Ruth enjoyed ?
Why was King Hezekiah a close friend of Jehovah ?
What qualities made Jesus ’ mother , Mary , a friend of Jehovah God ?
1 - 3 . ( a ) Why can we be sure that we can become God’s friends ?
( b ) What individuals will we consider in this article ?
IN THE Bible , Abraham is called God’s friend three times .
Does that mean that Abraham is the only human ever to become Jehovah’s friend ?
( Read Psalm 25 : 14 . )
They are part of the “ great cloud of witnesses ” mentioned by Paul .
All these different individuals were God’s friends . ​ — Hebrews 12 : 1 .
What difficult decision did Ruth have to make , and why was making it so hard ?
Naomi and her daughters - in - law , Ruth and Orpah , were walking the long distance from Moab to Israel .
What did Ruth decide to do ?
Would she go back home to Moab to be with her family , or would she stay with Naomi , her mother - in - law , and travel to Bethlehem ? ​ — Ruth 1 : 1 - 8 , 14 .
She could return to them , and they would probably take care of her .
And Naomi was afraid that she would not find a husband or a home for her .
So Naomi told her to go back to Moab .
But Ruth decided not to return to her people and their false gods .
( a ) What wise choice did Ruth make ?
( b ) Why did Boaz speak of Ruth as seeking refuge under Jehovah’s wings ?
It seems that Ruth learned about Jehovah from her husband or from Naomi .
She learned that Jehovah was not like the gods of Moab .
She loved Jehovah and knew that he deserved her love and her worship .
She told Naomi : “ Your people will be my people , and your God my God . ”
This also impressed Boaz , who later praised her for ‘ seeking refuge under Jehovah’s wings . ’
( Read Ruth 2 : 12 . )
The words Boaz used may remind us of how a baby bird looks for protection under its parent’s wings .
In a similar way , Jehovah gave Ruth loving protection and rewarded her for her faith .
Ruth never had any reason to regret her decision .
What might help those who hesitate to dedicate their lives to Jehovah ?
Many people learn about Jehovah but choose not to take refuge in him .
They hesitate to dedicate their lives to him and get baptized .
If you feel the same way , think about why you hesitate .
Everyone serves one god or another .
The wise choice would be to serve the true God .
When you dedicate yourself to Jehovah , you show that you have faith that he will be a refuge for you .
He was part of a nation that was dedicated to God .
Hezekiah’s father , King Ahaz , was wicked .
He showed disrespect for God’s temple and convinced the people to worship other gods .
Ahaz even had some of Hezekiah’s brothers burned alive as sacrifices to a false god .
Hezekiah had a terrible childhood ! ​ — 2 Kings 16 : 2 - 4 , 10 - 17 ; 2 Chronicles 28 : 1 - 3 .
9 , 10 . ( a ) Why might Hezekiah easily have become bitter ?
( b ) Why should we not become bitter against God ?
( c ) Why should we not think that our background determines the type of person we will become ?
The bad example of Ahaz could have caused his son Hezekiah to become bitter or angry with Jehovah .
Today , some who have had to endure far less than Hezekiah feel that they have good reason to become “ enraged against Jehovah ” or bitter toward his organization .
Others feel that their bad family background may cause them to have a bad life or to repeat their parents ’ mistakes .
Hezekiah’s life proves that the answer to that question is no !
He does not cause bad things to happen to people .
Because Jehovah has given us the gift of free will , which means that we can choose to do what is good or what is bad .
Many young people accept the truth despite their family background ( See paragraphs 9 , 10 )
What made Hezekiah one of Judah’s best kings ?
Even though his father was one of the worst kings in Judah , Hezekiah became one of the very best .
( Read 2 Kings 18 : 5 , 6 . )
This motivated him to fix many of the problems his father had caused .
He trusted in Jehovah’s protection and strengthened his people .
At one point Hezekiah became proud , but when Jehovah corrected him , he humbled himself .
He did not let his family background ruin his life .
Like Hezekiah , how have many today proved to be Jehovah’s friends ?
The world today is cruel and unloving , and many children grow up without loving and caring parents .
Even though many Christians today come from difficult family backgrounds , they have chosen to build a friendship with Jehovah .
Like Hezekiah , they show that their family background does not need to determine what kind of person they will become in the future .
God has given us the gift of free will , and we can choose to serve and honor him , as Hezekiah did .
Why might Mary’s assignment have seemed too difficult , yet how did she respond to Gabriel’s words ?
She would become pregnant and give birth to and raise God’s Son !
We often talk about the great honor Mary was given .
But what may have been some of her fears ?
How would she convince Joseph that she had not been unfaithful to him ?
In addition , she had the great responsibility of raising God’s Son as a human !
Why is Mary’s faith remarkable ?
How could Mary have such strong faith ?
But we can have faith if we cultivate it and ask God to bless our efforts .
What shows that Mary was a good listener ?
How Mary listened .
The Bible says that we “ must be quick to listen , slow to speak . ”
She took time to meditate on such important things .
One example of this was at Jesus ’ birth when shepherds told Mary about a message from an angel .
In both cases , Mary listened , remembered , and thought carefully about what she had heard . ​ — Read Luke 2 : 16 - 19 , 49 , 51 .
What can we learn about Mary from the way she spoke ?
The Bible does not tell us much about what Mary said .
Her longest speech is found at Luke 1 : 46 - 55 .
It seems that Mary quoted the Scriptures about 20 times in her speech .
In what ways can we imitate Mary’s faith ?
Like Mary , we may at times receive assignments from Jehovah that we think are too difficult for us .
Let us imitate her example , humbly accept the assignment , and trust that Jehovah will help us .
As we imitate the Bible’s outstanding examples of faith , of what may we be assured ?
It is clear that Ruth , Hezekiah , and Mary were Jehovah’s friends , just as Abraham was .
THINK about the happiest day of your life .
Was it when you got married or when your first child was born ?
Very likely , you have experienced much joy in serving Jehovah since your baptism .
What reasons do we have for continuing to serve Jehovah with joy ?
Because Jehovah promises that the Kingdom will soon put an end to this wicked world and bring in God’s new world .
Zephaniah 1 : 14 tells us : “ The great day of Jehovah is near ! It is near and it is approaching very quickly ! ”
But if we feel that we have to wait longer than expected , we could lose the joy we once had .
When we spend time with our brothers and sisters , we feel encouraged to keep on serving Jehovah with joy .
The good conduct of Jehovah’s people may have attracted us to true worship and helped us to begin serving God joyfully .
However , what could happen if one of our brothers or sisters was disciplined because he or she did not obey God’s commands ?
Satan’s world tries to convince us that we should buy things that we really do not need .
Remember that Jesus said : “ Come to me , all you who are toiling and loaded down , and I will refresh you .
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me , for I am mild - tempered and lowly in heart , and you will find refreshment for yourselves .
Being a true Christian is refreshing and brings us joy .
We certainly have good reasons for being joyful in Jehovah’s service .
Let us now consider three of them . ​ — Habakkuk 3 : 18 .
We serve our Life - Giver , the happy God .
We realize that we owe our lives to our Creator .
So let us continue to serve him with joy , regardless of how many years have gone by since we got baptized .
Héctor keeps his joy by remembering his Kingdom hope and staying active
Consider Héctor , who served Jehovah as a traveling overseer for 40 years .
“ Even in old age , ” he still enjoys serving Jehovah .
His wife’s illness has limited his activity in God’s service , but Héctor has not lost his joy .
He says : “ Although it is sad to see my wife’s health gradually deteriorate and it has been challenging to care for her , I have not allowed this to rob me of my joy in serving the true God .
Knowing that I owe my life to Jehovah , who created man for a purpose , is reason enough to love him deeply and serve him wholeheartedly .
I strive to stay active in the preaching work , and I try to keep the Kingdom hope foremost in my mind so as not to lose my joy . ”
Jehovah has provided the ransom sacrifice , making it possible for us to have a joyful life .
Indeed , “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten Son , so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ”
And our gratitude for the ransom will motivate us to serve Jehovah joyfully .
Jesús simplified his life and served Jehovah joyfully for years
I did it just to make more money .
Then I learned about Jehovah and how he had given his dear Son for mankind .
I had an intense desire to serve him .
So I dedicated my life to Jehovah , and after having worked for the company for 28 years , I decided to quit and take up the full - time ministry . ”
That is how Jesús started serving Jehovah with joy .
We live a morally clean life , which brings us happiness .
Do you remember what your life was like before you came to know Jehovah ?
The apostle Paul reminded Christians in Rome that they “ were once the slaves of sin ” but had become “ slaves to righteousness . ”
We too follow Jehovah’s standards , so we are free from the sadness that comes from an immoral or violent way of life .
What a cause for joy !
“ The happiest years of my life have been those spent serving Jehovah . ” ​ — Jaime
“ Little by little , I discovered the existence of a loving Father and merciful God , ” Jaime says .
“ Keeping Jehovah’s righteous standards has been a protection for me .
Had I not changed , I might have been killed , as some of my former boxing friends were .
The happiest years of my life have been those spent serving Jehovah . ”
How should we feel while we wait for the end of this wicked world ?
“ So let us not give up in doing what is fine , for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out . ”
With Jehovah’s help , let us endure , work hard to cultivate the qualities we need to survive “ the great tribulation , ” and continue to serve Jehovah with joy . ​ — Revelation 7 : 9 , 13 , 14 ; James 1 : 2 - 4 .
We can be confident that Jehovah will reward our endurance because he knows the work we do and the love we show for him and his name .
If we keep on serving him with joy , we will be like the psalmist David , who said : “ I keep Jehovah before me constantly .
And I reside in security . ” ​ — Psalm 16 : 8 , 9 .
How was King Saul’s son Jonathan loyal to Jehovah ?
How can we be loyal to God when we feel that someone who has authority does not deserve our respect ?
How can we be loyal to Jehovah if others misunderstand us or treat us unfairly ?
Why is Jonathan’s friendship with David a remarkable example of loyalty ?
JONATHAN must have been amazed at how courageous young David was .
David had killed the giant Goliath and brought “ the head of the Philistine ” to Jonathan’s father , King Saul of Israel .
Jonathan had no doubt that God was with David , and from then on , Jonathan and David became very close friends .
They promised that they would always be loyal to each other .
And when Saul was trying to kill David , Jonathan was worried about his friend .
He knew that David was in the wilderness at Horesh , so Jonathan went there to encourage him to keep relying on Jehovah .
Jonathan told David : “ Do not be afraid , for my father Saul will not find you ; you will be king over Israel , and I will become second to you . ” ​ — 1 Samuel 23 : 16 , 17 .
What was more important to Jonathan than being loyal to David , and how do we know ?
We usually admire people who are loyal .
In fact , that is the reason why he was loyal to David and was not jealous of him , although David would become king instead of him .
( a ) What will make us truly happy and satisfied ?
We too must be loyal to our family , our friends , and our brothers and sisters in the congregation .
But we know that we must be loyal to God even in difficult times .
In this article , we will discuss how Jonathan’s example can help us to stay loyal to Jehovah in four situations : ( 1 ) when we feel that someone who has authority does not deserve our respect , ( 2 ) when we have to choose to whom we should be loyal , ( 3 ) when a brother taking the lead misunderstands us or treats us unfairly , and ( 4 ) when we feel it is difficult to keep a promise .
Why was it difficult for the people of Israel to be loyal to God while Saul was king ?
Jonathan and the people of Israel were in a difficult situation .
King Saul , Jonathan’s father , had become disobedient , and Jehovah rejected him .
What shows that Jonathan stayed loyal to Jehovah ?
Jonathan stayed loyal to Jehovah .
At that time , a large army of Philistines came with 30,000 chariots to attack Israel .
But Jonathan was not afraid .
He remembered the words of the prophet Samuel : “ For the sake of his great name , Jehovah will not abandon his people . ”
Jonathan said to another soldier : “ Nothing can hinder Jehovah from saving by many or by few . ”
So he and the soldier attacked a group of Philistines and killed about 20 of them .
Jonathan had faith in Jehovah , and Jehovah blessed him .
Even though Saul continued to disobey Jehovah , Jonathan still obeyed his father whenever possible .
For example , they fought together to defend Jehovah’s people . ​ — 1 Samuel 31 : 1 , 2 .
How are we being loyal to God when we respect those who have authority ?
Like Jonathan , we can be loyal to Jehovah by obeying whenever possible the government of the country where we live .
That is why we should treat a government official with respect even when he is not honest and we feel he does not deserve our respect .
He even told her that he would leave her and take the children with him .
But Olga did not “ return evil for evil . ”
She did her best to be a good wife .
And when she could , she went with him to visit his family and friends .
After many years , Olga’s husband started to treat her better because she had been so patient and always showed him respect .
How did Jonathan know to whom he should be loyal ?
When Saul said that he was going to kill David , Jonathan had a difficult decision to make .
He wanted to be loyal to his father , but he also wanted to be loyal to David .
He warned David to hide and then told Saul why he should let David live . ​ — Read 1 Samuel 19 : 1 - 6 .
How does our love for God help us decide to be loyal to him ?
Alice , a sister from Australia , had to decide to whom she would be loyal .
She also told them that she would not celebrate Christmas with them and explained why .
They felt that Alice did not care about them anymore .
Then her mother said that she never wanted to see Alice again .
Alice said : “ I was shocked and deeply hurt because I really loved my family .
Nevertheless , I resolved that Jehovah and his Son would be first in my heart , and I got baptized at the next assembly . ” ​ — Matthew 10 : 37 .
We must not let loyalty to anything , such as a sports team , a school , or a country , become more important to us than our loyalty to Jehovah .
For example , Henry enjoyed playing chess with his school team and wanted to win a championship for his school .
Henry said that it had become more important for him to be loyal to the school than to God .
How can loyalty to God help us to cope with family problems ?
Sometimes it can be hard to be loyal to different members of our family at the same time .
For example , Ken says : “ I wanted to visit my elderly mother regularly and to have her stay with us occasionally .
But my mother and my wife did not get along well . ”
He continues : “ I could not please one without displeasing the other . ”
Ken thought about what the Bible says and realized that in this situation , he had to please his wife and be loyal to her .
So he found a solution that his wife was happy with .
He also explained to his mother why she should respect his wife . ​ — Read Genesis 2 : 24 ; 1 Corinthians 13 : 4 , 5 .
How did Saul treat Jonathan unfairly ?
We can also be loyal to Jehovah if a brother who is taking the lead treats us unfairly .
At the same time , he stayed loyal to Jehovah and to David , who was chosen by God to be the next king of Israel . ​ — 1 Samuel 20 : 30 - 41 .
If a brother treats us unfairly , how should we react ?
In our congregations today , the brothers taking the lead try to be fair to everyone .
So if we are ever misjudged or misunderstood , let us stay loyal to Jehovah .
In what situations must we be loyal to God and not be selfish ?
But Jonathan loved Jehovah and was loyal to him .
So instead of being selfish , Jonathan became David’s friend and kept his promise to him .
For example , if we make a business agreement , we will do what we agreed to do , even if this becomes difficult .
If we make a business agreement , we will do what we agreed to do because we are loyal to God ( See paragraph 16 )
We want to be loyal to God even in difficult situations , as Jonathan was .
So let us stay loyal to our brothers and sisters when they disappoint us .
Then we will make Jehovah’s heart rejoice , and that is what makes us happiest .
In the next article , we will see what we can learn from some in David’s time who were loyal and from others who were not loyal .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 9 ) Some names have been changed .
In difficult situations , we think of what he wants us to do and then obey him because we love him more than anyone or anything else
“ Superior authorities ” : The governments and officials that Jehovah allows to have authority over us .
He wants us to treat them with respect and obey them except when they want us to do something that he commands us not to do
Only to exercise justice , to cherish loyalty , and to walk in modesty with your God ! ” ​ — MICAH 6 : 8 .
Why was Jonathan’s reaction to David so different from Abner’s ?
What qualities will help us to be loyal to God , and how ?
How did David show that he was loyal to God ?
But David would not let him kill Saul .
He told Abishai : “ Do not harm him , for who can lift his hand against the anointed of Jehovah and remain innocent ? ”
David understood what he needed to do to be loyal to Jehovah .
He knew he should respect Saul , and he did not even think of hurting him .
Today , as in the past , Jehovah wants all of his servants to be loyal to him and respect those whom he allows to have authority . ​ — Read Micah 6 : 8 .
Abishai respected David because he knew that God had chosen David to be king .
Yet after becoming king , David committed serious sins .
( a ) How was David an example of loyalty to God ?
( b ) What other examples will we consider ?
David was loyal to Jehovah all his life .
Immediately , David admitted that he had sinned , and he repented .
Later , when David was an old man , he gave many valuable things to help build Jehovah’s temple .
And we will discuss other qualities that will help us to do so .
What lesson do we learn from Abishai’s mistake ?
When Abishai wanted to kill Saul , he was trying to be loyal to David .
But because David knew that it would be wrong to harm “ the anointed of Jehovah , ” he did not let Abishai kill the king .
This teaches us an important lesson : When we need to decide whom to be loyal to first , we need to think about which Bible principles can help us in our situation .
It is more important to be loyal to Jehovah than to anyone else
Although it is natural to be loyal to our family and friends , why must we be careful ?
It is natural to be loyal to someone we love , such as a friend or a family member .
How did one sister stay loyal to God in a difficult situation ?
For example , one day Anne’s mother , who was disfellowshipped , called her on the phone to say that she wanted to visit her .
Anne’s mother said that she was very unhappy because the family refused to talk to her .
Before she wrote the letter , Anne meditated on some Bible principles .
What qualities will help us to be loyal to God ?
Why did Abner try to kill David ?
In fact , later he even helped Saul , who wanted to kill David .
Both Jonathan and Abner knew that God wanted David to be the next king of Israel .
Later , Abner may have wanted to be king himself , and perhaps that is why he had sexual relations with one of King Saul’s wives .
Why did Jonathan and Abner feel so differently about David ?
Why was Absalom not loyal to God ?
Absalom , King David’s son , was not loyal to God because he was not humble .
He also convinced many Israelites to be loyal to him .
He even tried to kill his father , although he knew that Jehovah had made David king of Israel . ​ — 2 Samuel 15 : 13 , 14 ; 17 : 1 - 4 .
How can we benefit from Bible accounts about Abner , Absalom , and Baruch ?
Then Jehovah said to Baruch : “ Look ! What I have built up I am tearing down , and what I have planted I am uprooting ​ — the entire land .
But you are seeking great things for yourself .
Stop seeking such things . ”
Baruch listened to Jehovah .
Show why we cannot be loyal to God when we are selfish .
But then he realized that he was just selfishly doing what he wanted .
He was not being loyal to Jehovah , and he needed to be humble .
After many prayers and tears , that is what I did .
Soon , my joy in the ministry increased . ”
Daniel now has a wife who loves Jehovah , and he serves as a circuit overseer .
If you find out that your friend has committed a serious sin , will you talk to that person and make sure that he or she gets help from the elders ?
How did Nathan stay loyal to both God and David when David sinned ?
After David had taken a man’s wife and then killed him , Jehovah sent Nathan to counsel David .
Nathan was courageous and obeyed Jehovah .
He wanted to help David understand how serious his sins were .
So he told him a story of a rich man who stole the only lamb that a poor man had .
Nathan then said : “ You are the man ! ”
How can you be loyal to both Jehovah and your friend or relative ?
For example , you may have proof that a brother has committed a serious sin .
Tell him that he should ask the elders for help and that he should speak to them soon .
If he does not , then you should tell the elders yourself .
And at the same time , you are kind to your brother because the elders can help him to have a good relationship with Jehovah again .
They will correct him in a calm and gentle way . ​ — Read Leviticus 5 : 1 ; Galatians 6 : 1 .
Why did Hushai need courage to be loyal to God ?
Hushai was one of King David’s loyal friends .
When people wanted to make Absalom king , Hushai needed courage to stay loyal to David and to God .
He knew that Absalom had come to Jerusalem with his soldiers and that David had run away .
But what did Hushai do ?
Did he abandon David and support Absalom ?
Although David was old and many people wanted to kill him , Hushai stayed loyal to him because Jehovah had appointed David to be king .
So Hushai went to the Mount of Olives to meet David . ​ — 2 Samuel 15 : 30 , 32 .
Why do we need courage to be loyal ?
We need courage to be loyal to Jehovah and obey him instead of doing what our family members , workmates , or government authorities want us to do .
For example , ever since he was a little boy , Taro , in Japan , did all he could to make his parents happy .
But when he started to study with Jehovah’s Witnesses , his parents wanted him to stop .
I prayed for courage to stick to my decision .
Now their attitude has softened , and I can visit them regularly . ” ​ — Read Proverbs 29 : 25 .
How have you benefited from this study ?
We never want to be like Abner and Absalom , who were not loyal .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 7 ) Some names have been changed .
If we are loyal and humble , we will not focus on what we want but on what Jehovah wants us to do
If we are loyal and kind , we will try to help others , and we will treat them the way Jehovah wants us to
If we are loyal and courageous , we will obey Jehovah even when it is difficult or when we feel afraid
